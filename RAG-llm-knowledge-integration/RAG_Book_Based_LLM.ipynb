            " {'category': 'Adventure', 'author': 'Daniel Defoe', 'title': 'Robinson Crusoe', 'EN': 'CHAPTER I. START IN LIFE\\n\\n\\nI was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\\nsettled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my\\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called nay we call\\nourselves and write our name Crusoe; and so my companions always called\\nme.\\n\\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\\nSpaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\\nmy father or mother knew what became of me.\\n\\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head\\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who\\nwas very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;\\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,\\nthe commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and\\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\\nsomething fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the\\nlife of misery which was to befall me.\\n\\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a\\nmere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father s house and my\\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\\nraising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\\npleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\\nof this state by this one thing viz. that this was the state of life\\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\\nriches.\\n\\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day s\\nexperience to know it more sensibly.\\n\\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\\nbe none to assist in my recovery.\\n\\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\\nhimself I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\\nfull he could say no more to me.\\n\\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\\nsettle at home according to my father s desire. But alas! a few days\\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father s further\\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\\nhim. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her\\na little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts\\nwere so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle\\nto anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\\ntrade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never\\nserve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master\\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did\\nnot like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double\\ndiligence, to recover the time that I had lost.\\n\\nThis put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would\\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\\nmuch for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\\nthing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and\\ntender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in\\nshort, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she\\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.\\n\\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard\\nafterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my\\nfather, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh,\\n That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes\\nabroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can\\ngive no consent to it. \\n\\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in\\nthe meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\\nto business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother\\nabout their being so positively determined against what they knew my\\ninclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went\\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;\\nbut, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail\\nto London in his father s ship, and prompting me to go with them with\\nthe common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing\\nfor my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so\\nmuch as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they\\nmight, without asking God s blessing or my father s, without any\\nconsideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God\\nknows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for\\nLondon. Never any young adventurer s misfortunes, I believe, began\\nsooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of\\nthe Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most\\nfrightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most\\ninexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously\\nto reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the\\njudgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father s house, and\\nabandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father s\\ntears and my mother s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my\\nconscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it\\nhas since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of\\nmy duty to God and my father.\\n\\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though\\nnothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a\\nfew days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a\\nyoung sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I expected\\nevery wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship\\nfell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we\\nshould never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and\\nresolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one\\nvoyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go\\ndirectly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I\\nlived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such\\nmiseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his\\nobservations about the middle station of life, how easy, how\\ncomfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to\\ntempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like\\na true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.\\n\\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted,\\nand indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and\\nthe sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was\\nvery grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but\\ntowards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a\\ncharming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and\\nrose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth\\nsea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most\\ndelightful that ever I saw.\\n\\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very\\ncheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and\\nterrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so\\nlittle a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue,\\nmy companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me;  Well, Bob,  says\\nhe, clapping me upon the shoulder,  how do you do after it? I warrant\\nyou were frighted, wer n t you, last night, when it blew but a capful\\nof wind?   A capful d you call it?  said I;  twas a terrible storm. \\n A storm, you fool you,  replies he;  do you call that a storm? why, it\\nwas nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think\\nnothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you re but a fresh-water\\nsailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we ll forget all\\nthat; d ye see what charming weather  tis now?  To make short this sad\\npart of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made\\nand I was made half drunk with it: and in that one night s wickedness I\\ndrowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all\\nmy resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to\\nits smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that\\nstorm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and\\napprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the\\ncurrent of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and\\npromises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of\\nreflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to\\nreturn again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from\\nthem as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and\\ncompany, soon mastered the return of those fits for so I called them;\\nand I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience\\nas any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could\\ndesire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence,\\nas in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely\\nwithout excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the\\nnext was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among\\nus would confess both the danger and the mercy of.\\n\\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\\nhaving been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way\\nsince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we\\nlay, the wind continuing contrary viz. at south-west for seven or eight\\ndays, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the\\nsame Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind\\nfor the river.\\n\\nWe had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up\\nthe river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four\\nor five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good\\nas a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,\\nour men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger,\\nbut spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but\\nthe eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all\\nhands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and\\nclose, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea\\nwent very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several\\nseas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which\\nour master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two\\nanchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.\\n\\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see\\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The\\nmaster, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as\\nhe went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to\\nhimself say, several times,  Lord be merciful to us! we shall be all\\nlost! we shall be all undone!  and the like. During these first hurries\\nI was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and\\ncannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which\\nI had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I\\nthought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be\\nnothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I\\nsaid just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully\\nfrighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal\\nsight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every\\nthree or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but\\ndistress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their\\nmasts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship\\nwhich rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships,\\nbeing driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at\\nall adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships\\nfared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three\\nof them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their\\nspritsail out before the wind.\\n\\nTowards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to\\nlet them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but\\nthe boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would\\nfounder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the\\nmain-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged\\nto cut that away also, and make a clear deck.\\n\\nAny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was\\nbut a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a\\nlittle. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about\\nme at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of\\nmy former convictions, and the having returned from them to the\\nresolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;\\nand these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a\\ncondition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not\\ncome yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves\\nacknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she\\nwas deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now\\nand then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one\\nrespect, that I did not know what they meant by _founder_ till I\\ninquired. However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not\\noften seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible\\nthan the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the\\nship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all\\nthe rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see\\ncried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water\\nin the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my\\nheart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side\\nof my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and\\ntold me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to\\npump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked\\nvery heartily. While this was doing the master, seeing some light\\ncolliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and\\nrun away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a\\nsignal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the\\nship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so\\nsurprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when\\neverybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was\\nbecome of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me\\naside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a\\ngreat while before I came to myself.\\n\\nWe worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent\\nthat the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a\\nlittle, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into\\nany port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light\\nship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help\\nus. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was\\nimpossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the\\nship s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing\\ntheir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with\\na buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after\\nmuch labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under\\nour stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them\\nor us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship;\\nso all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore\\nas much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was\\nstaved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly\\nrowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping\\ntowards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.\\n\\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we\\nsaw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant\\nby a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes\\nto look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment\\nthat they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go\\nin, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright,\\npartly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.\\n\\nWhile we were in this condition the men yet labouring at the oar to\\nbring the boat near the shore we could see (when, our boat mounting the\\nwaves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along\\nthe strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow\\nway towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being\\npast the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward\\ntowards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the\\nwind. Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all\\nsafe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as\\nunfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the\\nmagistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by\\nparticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us\\nsufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we thought\\nfit.\\n\\nHad I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home,\\nI had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour s parable,\\nhad even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went\\naway in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he\\nhad any assurances that I was not drowned.\\n\\nBut my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could\\nresist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my\\nmore composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know\\nnot what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling\\ndecree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own\\ndestruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with\\nour eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable\\nmisery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me\\nforward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired\\nthoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with\\nin my first attempt.\\n\\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the\\nmaster s son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to\\nme after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for\\nwe were separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first\\ntime he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very\\nmelancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling\\nhis father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,\\nin order to go further abroad, his father, turning to me with a very\\ngrave and concerned tone  Young man,  says he,  you ought never to go\\nto sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token\\nthat you are not to be a seafaring man.   Why, sir,  said I,  will you\\ngo to sea no more?   That is another case,  said he;  it is my calling,\\nand therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see\\nwhat a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you\\npersist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah\\nin the ship of Tarshish. Pray,  continues he,  what are you; and on\\nwhat account did you go to sea?  Upon that I told him some of my story;\\nat the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion:  What\\nhad I done,  says he,  that such an unhappy wretch should come into my\\nship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a\\nthousand pounds.  This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his\\nspirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was\\nfarther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards\\ntalked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and\\nnot tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand\\nof Heaven against me.  And, young man,  said he,  depend upon it, if\\nyou do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but\\ndisasters and disappointments, till your father s words are fulfilled\\nupon you. \\n\\nWe parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no\\nmore; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in my\\npocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the\\nroad, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take,\\nand whether I should go home or to sea.\\n\\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my\\nthoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at\\namong the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and\\nmother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often\\nobserved, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind\\nis, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in\\nsuch cases viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed\\nto repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be\\nesteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make\\nthem be esteemed wise men.\\n\\nIn this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what\\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible\\nreluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed away a while, the\\nremembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated,\\nthe little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till\\nat last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a\\nvoyage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. SLAVERY AND ESCAPE\\n\\n\\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my father s\\nhouse which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising\\nmy fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to\\nmake me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the\\ncommands of my father I say, the same influence, whatever it was,\\npresented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I\\nwent on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors\\nvulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea.\\n\\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship\\nmyself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little\\nharder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learnt the\\nduty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time might have qualified\\nmyself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was\\nalways my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money\\nin my pocket and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board\\nin the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the\\nship, nor learned to do any.\\n\\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,\\nwhich does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows\\nas I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for\\nthem very early; but it was not so with me. I first got acquainted with\\nthe master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who,\\nhaving had very good success there, was resolved to go again. This\\ncaptain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all\\ndisagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the\\nworld, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no\\nexpense; I should be his messmate and his companion; and if I could\\ncarry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the\\ntrade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.\\n\\nI embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this\\ncaptain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with\\nhim, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested\\nhonesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I\\ncarried about  40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me\\nto buy. These  40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of\\nmy relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my\\nfather, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my\\nfirst adventure.\\n\\nThis was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my\\nadventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the\\ncaptain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics\\nand the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the\\nship s course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some\\nthings that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took\\ndelight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this\\nvoyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five\\npounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in\\nLondon, at my return, almost  300; and this filled me with those\\naspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.\\n\\nYet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I\\nwas continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the\\nexcessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the\\ncoast, from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.\\n\\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great\\nmisfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same\\nvoyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his\\nmate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.\\nThis was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not\\ncarry quite  100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had  200 left,\\nwhich I had lodged with my friend s widow, who was very just to me, yet\\nI fell into terrible misfortunes. The first was this: our ship making\\nher course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands\\nand the African shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a\\nTurkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she\\ncould make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread,\\nor our masts carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon\\nus, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to\\nfight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About three\\nin the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just\\nathwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we\\nbrought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a\\nbroadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our\\nfire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men\\nwhich he had on board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men\\nkeeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend\\nourselves. But laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter,\\nhe entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting\\nand hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small shot,\\nhalf-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them\\ntwice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our\\nship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we\\nwere obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a\\nport belonging to the Moors.\\n\\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended;\\nnor was I carried up the country to the emperor s court, as the rest of\\nour men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper\\nprize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his\\nbusiness. At this surprising change of my circumstances, from a\\nmerchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I\\nlooked back upon my father s prophetic discourse to me, that I should\\nbe miserable and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so\\neffectually brought to pass that I could not be worse; for now the hand\\nof Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption; but,\\nalas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will\\nappear in the sequel of this story.\\n\\nAs my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was\\nin hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again,\\nbelieving that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a\\nSpanish or Portugal man-of-war; and that then I should be set at\\nliberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to\\nsea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the\\ncommon drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again\\nfrom his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the\\nship.\\n\\nHere I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to\\neffect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it;\\nnothing presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had\\nnobody to communicate it to that would embark with me no fellow-slave,\\nno Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two\\nyears, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never\\nhad the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.\\n\\nAfter about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put\\nthe old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.\\nMy patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,\\nwhich, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or\\ntwice a week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take the\\nship s pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always\\ntook me and young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very\\nmerry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that\\nsometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the\\nyouth the Maresco, as they called him to catch a dish of fish for him.\\n\\nIt happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog\\nrose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we\\nlost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we\\nlaboured all day, and all the next night; and when the morning came we\\nfound we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and\\nthat we were at least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well\\nin again, though with a great deal of labour and some danger; for the\\nwind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but we were all very\\nhungry.\\n\\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of\\nhimself for the future; and having lying by him the longboat of our\\nEnglish ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing\\nany more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the\\ncarpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little\\nstate-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a\\nbarge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the\\nmain-sheet; the room before for a hand or two to stand and work the\\nsails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the\\nboom jibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and\\nhad in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat\\non, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he\\nthought fit to drink; and his bread, rice, and coffee.\\n\\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most\\ndexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened\\nthat he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or\\nfor fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place,\\nand for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had, therefore, sent\\non board the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary;\\nand had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,\\nwhich were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of\\nfowling as well as fishing.\\n\\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning\\nwith the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and\\neverything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on\\nboard alone, and told me his guests had put off going from some\\nbusiness that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual,\\nto go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends\\nwere to sup at his house, and commanded that as soon as I got some fish\\nI should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to do.\\n\\nThis moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,\\nfor now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and\\nmy master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing\\nbusiness, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as\\nconsider, whither I should steer anywhere to get out of that place was\\nmy desire.\\n\\nMy first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to\\nget something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not\\npresume to eat of our patron s bread. He said that was true; so he\\nbrought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh\\nwater, into the boat. I knew where my patron s case of bottles stood,\\nwhich it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English\\nprize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore,\\nas if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a\\ngreat lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed about half a\\nhundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and\\na hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially\\nthe wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he\\ninnocently came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley,\\nor Moely; so I called to him Moely,  said I,  our patron s guns are on\\nboard the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we\\nmay kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I\\nknow he keeps the gunner s stores in the ship.   Yes,  says he,  I ll\\nbring some;  and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which\\nheld a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with\\nshot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into\\nthe boat. At the same time I had found some powder of my master s in\\nthe great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the\\ncase, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and\\nthus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to\\nfish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we\\nwere, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the\\nport before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish. The wind\\nblew from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown\\nsoutherly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least\\nreached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it\\nwould, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave\\nthe rest to fate.\\n\\nAfter we had fished some time and caught nothing for when I had fish on\\nmy hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them I said to\\nthe Moor,  This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we\\nmust stand farther off.  He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the\\nhead of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat\\nout near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish;\\nwhen, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,\\nand making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by\\nsurprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard\\ninto the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called\\nto me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world\\nwith me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me\\nvery quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into\\nthe cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at\\nhim, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I\\nwould do him none.  But,  said I,  you swim well enough to reach to the\\nshore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I\\nwill do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I ll shoot you\\nthrough the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty;  so he turned\\nhimself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he\\nreached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.\\n\\nI could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have\\ndrowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was\\ngone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him,\\n Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I ll make you a great man; but if\\nyou will not stroke your face to be true to me that is, swear by\\nMahomet and his father s beard I must throw you into the sea too.  The\\nboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could not\\ndistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world\\nwith me.\\n\\nWhile I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly\\nto sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might\\nthink me gone towards the Straits  mouth (as indeed any one that had\\nbeen in their wits must have been supposed to do): for who would have\\nsupposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian\\ncoast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with\\ntheir canoes and destroy us; where we could not go on shore but we\\nshould be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human\\nkind.\\n\\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and\\nsteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little towards\\nthe east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh\\ngale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe\\nby the next day, at three o clock in the afternoon, when I first made\\nthe land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of\\nSallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco s dominions, or indeed of\\nany other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.\\n\\nYet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful\\napprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,\\nor go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I\\nhad sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the\\nsouthward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of\\nme, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,\\nand came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what,\\nnor where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what\\nriver. I neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal\\nthing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,\\nresolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the\\ncountry; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful\\nnoises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we\\nknew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and\\nbegged of me not to go on shore till day.  Well, Xury,  said I,  then I\\nwon t; but it may be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to\\nus as those lions.   Then we give them the shoot gun,  says Xury,\\nlaughing,  make them run wey.  Such English Xury spoke by conversing\\namong us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I\\ngave him a dram (out of our patron s case of bottles) to cheer him up.\\nAfter all, Xury s advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little\\nanchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in\\ntwo or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to\\ncall them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the\\nwater, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling\\nthemselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I\\nnever indeed heard the like.\\n\\nXury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both\\nmore frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming\\ntowards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his\\nblowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a\\nlion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to\\nweigh the anchor and row away;  No,  says I,  Xury; we can slip our\\ncable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us\\nfar.  I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever\\nit was) within two oars  length, which something surprised me; however,\\nI immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at\\nhim; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore\\nagain.\\n\\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries\\nand howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as\\nhigher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing\\nI have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before:\\nthis convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night\\non that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another\\nquestion too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages\\nhad been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and\\ntigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.\\n\\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other\\nfor water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to\\nget to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with\\none of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some\\nto me. I asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in\\nthe boat? The boy answered with so much affection as made me love him\\never after. Says he,  If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey. \\n Well, Xury,  said I,  we will both go and if the wild mans come, we\\nwill kill them, they shall eat neither of us.  So I gave Xury a piece\\nof rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron s case of bottles\\nwhich I mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore\\nas we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but\\nour arms and two jars for water.\\n\\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of\\ncanoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place\\nabout a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by I saw him\\ncome running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or\\nfrighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help\\nhim; but when I came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his\\nshoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but\\ndifferent in colour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,\\nand it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with,\\nwas to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans.\\n\\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for\\na little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh\\nwhen the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled\\nour jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on\\nour way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of\\nthe country.\\n\\nAs I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that\\nthe islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay\\nnot far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an\\nobservation to know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing,\\nor at least remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where\\nto look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I\\nmight now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,\\nthat if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the\\nEnglish traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual\\ndesign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.\\n\\nBy the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that\\ncountry which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco s dominions and the\\nnegroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes\\nhaving abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and\\nthe Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness;\\nand indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of\\ntigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour\\nthere; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go\\nlike an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near\\na hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste,\\nuninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring\\nof wild beasts by night.\\n\\nOnce or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,\\nbeing the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a\\ngreat mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having\\ntried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also\\ngoing too high for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first\\ndesign, and keep along the shore.\\n\\nSeveral times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left\\nthis place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to\\nan anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the\\ntide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes\\nwere more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and\\ntells me that we had best go farther off the shore;  For,  says he,\\n look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast\\nasleep.  I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,\\nfor it was a terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore,\\nunder the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little\\nover him.  Xury,  says I,  you shall on shore and kill him.  Xury,\\nlooked frighted, and said,  Me kill! he eat me at one mouth! one\\nmouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie\\nstill, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and\\nloaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it\\ndown; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we\\nhad three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best\\naim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he\\nlay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit\\nhis leg about the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at\\nfirst, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got upon\\nthree legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a\\nlittle surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up\\nthe second piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired\\nagain, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop\\nand make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took\\nheart, and would have me let him go on shore.  Well, go,  said I: so\\nthe boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand, swam\\nto shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the\\nmuzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which\\ndespatched him quite.\\n\\nThis was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry\\nto lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good\\nfor nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he\\ncomes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.  For what, Xury? \\nsaid I.  Me cut off his head,  said he. However, Xury could not cut off\\nhis head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a\\nmonstrous great one.\\n\\nI bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one\\nway or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his\\nskin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much\\nthe better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it\\ntook us both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him,\\nand spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it\\nin two days  time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. WRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND\\n\\n\\nAfter this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or\\ntwelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to\\nabate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged\\nto for fresh water. My design in this was to make the river Gambia or\\nSenegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verde, where I was\\nin hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not\\nwhat course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there\\namong the negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed\\neither to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made\\nthis cape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my\\nfortune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship\\nor must perish.\\n\\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have\\nsaid, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three\\nplaces, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at\\nus; we could also perceive they were quite black and naked. I was once\\ninclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better\\ncounsellor, and said to me,  No go, no go.  However, I hauled in nearer\\nthe shore that I might talk to them, and I found they ran along the\\nshore by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hand,\\nexcept one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance,\\nand that they could throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at\\na distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and\\nparticularly made signs for something to eat: they beckoned to me to\\nstop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered\\nthe top of my sail and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country,\\nand in less than half-an-hour came back, and brought with them two\\npieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their\\ncountry; but we neither knew what the one or the other was; however, we\\nwere willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute,\\nfor I would not venture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid\\nof us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the\\nshore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we\\nfetched it on board, and then came close to us again.\\n\\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them\\namends; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them\\nwonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty\\ncreatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from\\nthe mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the\\nfemale, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,\\nany more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange, but I\\nbelieve it was the latter; because, in the first place, those ravenous\\ncreatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in the second place, we\\nfound the people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that\\nhad the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did; however,\\nas the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not offer to\\nfall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and\\nswam about, as if they had come for their diversion; at last one of\\nthem began to come nearer our boat than at first I expected; but I lay\\nready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition,\\nand bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my\\nreach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head; immediately he sank\\ndown into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if\\nhe were struggling for life, and so indeed he was; he immediately made\\nto the shore; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the\\nstrangling of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.\\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at\\nthe noise and fire of my gun: some of them were even ready to die for\\nfear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the\\ncreature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to\\ncome to the shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for\\nthe creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and by the\\nhelp of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to haul,\\nthey dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious\\nleopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held\\nup their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him\\nwith.\\n\\nThe other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of\\nthe gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from\\nwhence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I\\nfound quickly the negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so\\nI was willing to have them take it as a favour from me; which, when I\\nmade signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful\\nfor. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had no\\nknife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as\\nreadily, and much more readily, than we could have done with a knife.\\nThey offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that\\nI would give it them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me\\nvery freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions,\\nwhich, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs\\nto them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it\\nbottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it\\nfilled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and there\\ncame two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as\\nI supposed, in the sun, this they set down to me, as before, and I sent\\nXury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were\\nas naked as the men.\\n\\nI was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and\\nleaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,\\nwithout offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a\\ngreat length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five\\nleagues before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing\\nto make this point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues\\nfrom the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I\\nconcluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de\\nVerde, and those the islands called, from thence, Cape de Verde\\nIslands. However, they were at a great distance, and I could not well\\ntell what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of\\nwind, I might neither reach one or other.\\n\\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and\\nsat down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,\\n Master, master, a ship with a sail!  and the foolish boy was frighted\\nout of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master s ships\\nsent to pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach. I\\njumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but\\nthat it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the\\ncoast of Guinea, for negroes. But, when I observed the course she\\nsteered, I was soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did\\nnot design to come any nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out\\nto sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them if possible.\\n\\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in\\ntheir way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any\\nsignal to them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to\\ndespair, they, it seems, saw by the help of their glasses that it was\\nsome European boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship that\\nwas lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged\\nwith this, and as I had my patron s ancient on board, I made a waft of\\nit to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they\\nsaw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the\\ngun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me;\\nand in about three hours; time I came up with them.\\n\\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,\\nbut I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch sailor, who was on\\nboard, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an\\nEnglishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at\\nSallee; they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,\\nand all my goods.\\n\\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I\\nwas thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost\\nhopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to\\nthe captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he\\ngenerously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had\\nshould be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils.  For,  says\\nhe,  I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to\\nbe saved myself: and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken\\nup in the same condition. Besides,  said he,  when I carry you to the\\nBrazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from\\nyou what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away\\nthat life I have given. No, no,  says he:  Seignior Inglese  (Mr.\\nEnglishman),  I will carry you thither in charity, and those things\\nwill help to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home again. \\n\\nAs he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the\\nperformance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should\\ntouch anything that I had: then he took everything into his own\\npossession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might\\nhave them, even to my three earthen jars.\\n\\nAs to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he\\nwould buy it of me for his ship s use; and asked me what I would have\\nfor it? I told him he had been so generous to me in everything that I\\ncould not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to\\nhim: upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me\\neighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any\\none offered to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty\\npieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not\\nthat I was unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loth\\nto sell the poor boy s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in\\nprocuring my own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it\\nto be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an\\nobligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon\\nthis, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain\\nhave him.\\n\\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de\\nTodos los Santos, or All Saints  Bay, in about twenty-two days after.\\nAnd now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all\\nconditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.\\n\\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough remember:\\nhe would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for\\nthe leopard s skin, and forty for the lion s skin, which I had in my\\nboat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually\\ndelivered to me; and what I was willing to sell he bought of me, such\\nas the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of\\nbeeswax for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two\\nhundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock\\nI went on shore in the Brazils.\\n\\nI had not been long here before I was recommended to the house of a\\ngood honest man like himself, who had an _ingenio_, as they call it\\n(that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time,\\nand acquainted myself by that means with the manner of planting and\\nmaking of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they\\ngot rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle\\nthere, I would turn planter among them: resolving in the meantime to\\nfind out some way to get my money, which I had left in London, remitted\\nto me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalisation, I\\npurchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, and\\nformed a plan for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be\\nsuitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from\\nEngland.\\n\\nI had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English\\nparents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was.\\nI call him my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and\\nwe went on very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as\\nhis; and we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two\\nyears. However, we began to increase, and our land began to come into\\norder; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of\\nus a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to\\ncome. But we both wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had\\ndone wrong in parting with my boy Xury.\\n\\nBut, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great\\nwonder. I had no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment\\nquite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I\\ndelighted in, and for which I forsook my father s house, and broke\\nthrough all his good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very middle\\nstation, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to\\nbefore, and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have\\nstayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I had\\ndone; and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well\\nin England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off to\\ndo it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a\\ndistance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least\\nknowledge of me.\\n\\nIn this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.\\nI had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work\\nto be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived\\njust like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody\\nthere but himself. But how just has it been and how should all men\\nreflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others\\nthat are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be\\nconvinced of their former felicity by their experience I say, how just\\nhas it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island\\nof mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly\\ncompared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued,\\nI had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.\\n\\nI was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the\\nplantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me\\nup at sea, went back for the ship remained there, in providing his\\nlading and preparing for his voyage, nearly three months when telling\\nhim what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this\\nfriendly and sincere advice: Seignior Inglese,  says he (for so he\\nalways called me),  if you will give me letters, and a procuration in\\nform to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London to\\nsend your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in\\nsuch goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce\\nof them, God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are all\\nsubject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for\\none hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and\\nlet the hazard be run for the first; so that, if it come safe, you may\\norder the rest the same way, and, if it miscarry, you may have the\\nother half to have recourse to for your supply. \\n\\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not\\nbut be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly\\nprepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and\\na procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.\\n\\nI wrote the English captain s widow a full account of all my\\nadventures my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese\\ncaptain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was\\nnow in, with all other necessary directions for my supply; and when\\nthis honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the\\nEnglish merchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a full\\naccount of my story to a merchant in London, who represented it\\neffectually to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money, but out\\nof her own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for\\nhis humanity and charity to me.\\n\\nThe merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,\\nsuch as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at\\nLisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which,\\nwithout my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of\\nthem), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and\\nutensils necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to\\nme.\\n\\nWhen this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised\\nwith the joy of it; and my stood steward, the captain, had laid out the\\nfive pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to\\npurchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years \\nservice, and would not accept of any consideration, except a little\\ntobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own produce.\\n\\nNeither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such\\nas cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and\\ndesirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a very great\\nadvantage; so that I might say I had more than four times the value of\\nmy first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour I mean\\nin the advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I\\nbought me a negro slave, and an European servant also I mean another\\nbesides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.\\n\\nBut as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our\\ngreatest adversity, so it was with me. I went on the next year with\\ngreat success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco\\non my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my\\nneighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight,\\nwere well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from\\nLisbon: and now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be\\nfull of projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed,\\noften the ruin of the best heads in business. Had I continued in the\\nstation I was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet\\nbefallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet,\\nretired life, and of which he had so sensibly described the middle\\nstation of life to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was\\nstill to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly,\\nto increase my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in\\nmy future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages\\nwere procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish\\ninclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in\\ncontradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and\\nplain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of life, which\\nnature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make my\\nduty.\\n\\nAs I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could\\nnot be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of\\nbeing a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a\\nrash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the\\nthing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf\\nof human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent\\nwith life and a state of health in the world.\\n\\nTo come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of\\nmy story. You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in\\nthe Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my\\nplantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted\\nacquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among\\nthe merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my\\ndiscourses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two\\nvoyages to the coast of Guinea: the manner of trading with the negroes\\nthere, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles such\\nas beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the\\nlike not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants  teeth, &c., but\\nnegroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.\\n\\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,\\nbut especially to that part which related to the buying of negroes,\\nwhich was a trade at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as\\nfar as it was, had been carried on by assientos, or permission of the\\nkings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock: so that\\nfew negroes were bought, and these excessively dear.\\n\\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my\\nacquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them\\ncame to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much\\nupon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came\\nto make a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy,\\nthey told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;\\nthat they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for\\nnothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be\\ncarried on, because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they\\ncame home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes\\non shore privately, and divide them among their own plantations; and,\\nin a word, the question was whether I would go their supercargo in the\\nship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they\\noffered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes, without\\nproviding any part of the stock.\\n\\nThis was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any\\none that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look\\nafter, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and\\nwith a good stock upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and\\nestablished, and had nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for\\nthree or four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds\\nfrom England; and who in that time, and with that little addition,\\ncould scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds\\nsterling, and that increasing too for me to think of such a voyage was\\nthe most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could\\nbe guilty of.\\n\\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the\\noffer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father s\\ngood counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with\\nall my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my\\nabsence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I\\nmiscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or\\ncovenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my\\nplantation and effects in case of my death, making the captain of the\\nship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging\\nhim to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of\\nthe produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.\\n\\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and to\\nkeep up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have looked\\ninto my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have\\ndone and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so\\nprosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving\\ncircumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its\\ncommon hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect\\nparticular misfortunes to myself.\\n\\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy\\nrather than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and\\nthe cargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my\\npartners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st\\nSeptember 1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my\\nfather and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their\\nauthority, and the fool to my own interests.\\n\\nOur ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns\\nand fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had on\\nboard no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our\\ntrade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other\\ntrifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets,\\nand the like.\\n\\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the\\nnorthward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the\\nAfrican coast when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern\\nlatitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in those days. We\\nhad very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon our own\\ncoast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence,\\nkeeping further off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we\\nwere bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by\\nN., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the\\nline in about twelve days  time, and were, by our last observation, in\\nseven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent\\ntornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began\\nfrom the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled in\\nthe north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for\\ntwelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away\\nbefore it, let it carry us whither fate and the fury of the winds\\ndirected; and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected\\nevery day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect\\nto save their lives.\\n\\nIn this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our\\nmen die of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed overboard.\\nAbout the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an\\nobservation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven\\ndegrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude\\ndifference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was upon\\nthe coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river\\nAmazon, toward that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great\\nRiver; and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the\\nship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going directly back\\nto the coast of Brazil.\\n\\nI was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the\\nsea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited\\ncountry for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of\\nthe Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for\\nBarbadoes; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the\\nBay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about\\nfifteen days  sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to\\nthe coast of Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to\\nourselves.\\n\\nWith this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W., in\\norder to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief.\\nBut our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of\\ntwelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which\\ncarried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out\\nof the way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as\\nto the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than\\never returning to our own country.\\n\\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men\\nearly in the morning cried out,  Land!  and we had no sooner run out of\\nthe cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we\\nwere, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment her motion\\nbeing so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that we\\nexpected we should all have perished immediately; and we were\\nimmediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very\\nfoam and spray of the sea.\\n\\nIt is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to\\ndescribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We\\nknew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were\\ndriven whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not\\ninhabited. As the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less\\nthan at first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many\\nminutes without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of\\nmiracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking upon\\none another, and expecting death every moment, and every man,\\naccordingly, preparing for another world; for there was little or\\nnothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present comfort,\\nand all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the\\nship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to\\nabate.\\n\\nNow, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship\\nhaving thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to\\nexpect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had\\nnothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We\\nhad a boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved\\nby dashing against the ship s rudder, and in the next place she broke\\naway, and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope\\nfrom her. We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the\\nsea was a doubtful thing. However, there was no time to debate, for we\\nfancied that the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told\\nus she was actually broken already.\\n\\nIn this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with\\nthe help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship s side; and\\ngetting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in\\nnumber, to God s mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was\\nabated considerably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore,\\nand might be well called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the sea in a\\nstorm.\\n\\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that\\nthe sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should\\nbe inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor if we had\\ncould we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards\\nthe land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we\\nall knew that when the boat came near the shore she would be dashed in\\na thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our\\nsouls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us\\ntowards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands,\\npulling as well as we could towards land.\\n\\nWhat the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we\\nknew not. The only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow\\nof expectation was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of\\nsome river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got\\nunder the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was\\nnothing like this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore,\\nthe land looked more frightful than the sea.\\n\\nAfter we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a half, as we\\nreckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us,\\nand plainly bade us expect the _coup de gr ce_. It took us with such a\\nfury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from\\nthe boat as from one another, gave us no time to say,  O God!  for we\\nwere all swallowed up in a moment.\\n\\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sank\\ninto the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver\\nmyself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having\\ndriven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and\\nhaving spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry,\\nbut half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind,\\nas well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I\\nexpected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the\\nland as fast as I could before another wave should return and take me\\nup again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the\\nsea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy,\\nwhich I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to\\nhold my breath, and raise myself upon the water if I could; and so, by\\nswimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,\\nif possible, my greatest concern now being that the sea, as it would\\ncarry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry\\nme back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.\\n\\nThe wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty\\nfeet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a\\nmighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I\\nheld my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my\\nmight. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt\\nmyself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands\\nshoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was not two\\nseconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me\\ngreatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was covered again with\\nwater a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the\\nwater had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against\\nthe return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood\\nstill a few moments to recover breath, and till the waters went from\\nme, and then took to my heels and ran with what strength I had further\\ntowards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of\\nthe sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice more I was\\nlifted up by the waves and carried forward as before, the shore being\\nvery flat.\\n\\nThe last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for the sea\\nhaving hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,\\nagainst a piece of rock, and that with such force, that it left me\\nsenseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow\\ntaking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my\\nbody; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled\\nin the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,\\nand seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold\\nfast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,\\ntill the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at\\nfirst, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then\\nfetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that the next\\nwave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry\\nme away; and the next run I took, I got to the mainland, where, to my\\ngreat comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat me down\\nupon the grass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the\\nwater.\\n\\nI was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God\\nthat my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before\\nscarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the\\nlife, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so\\nsaved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at\\nthe custom, when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is\\ntied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to\\nhim I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let\\nhim blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may\\nnot drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him.\\n\\n For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. \\n\\n\\nI walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as\\nI may say, wrapped up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a\\nthousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon\\nall my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one\\nsoul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards,\\nor any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes\\nthat were not fellows.\\n\\nI cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the\\nsea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and\\nconsidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?\\n\\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition,\\nI began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what\\nwas next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a\\nword, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to\\nshift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither\\ndid I see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or\\nbeing devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly\\nafflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any\\ncreature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other\\ncreature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had\\nnothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a\\nbox. This was all my provisions; and this threw me into such terrible\\nagonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night\\ncoming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my\\nlot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they\\nalways come abroad for their prey.\\n\\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up\\ninto a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and\\nwhere I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death\\nI should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a\\nfurlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to\\ndrink, which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little\\ntobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and\\ngetting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so that if I should\\nsleep I might not fall. And having cut me a short stick, like a\\ntruncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and having been\\nexcessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as,\\nI believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself more\\nrefreshed with it than, I think, I ever was on such an occasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. FIRST WEEKS ON THE ISLAND\\n\\n\\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,\\nso that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that which\\nsurprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from\\nthe sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up\\nalmost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been\\nso bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a\\nmile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright\\nstill, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some\\nnecessary things for my use.\\n\\nWhen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me\\nagain, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind\\nand the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my\\nright hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to\\nher; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which\\nwas about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more\\nintent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my\\npresent subsistence.\\n\\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so\\nfar out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And\\nhere I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if\\nwe had kept on board we had been all safe that is to say, we had all\\ngot safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left\\nentirely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was. This forced\\ntears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I\\nresolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my\\nclothes for the weather was hot to extremity and took the water. But\\nwhen I came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to\\nget on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there\\nwas nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and\\nthe second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did\\nnot see at first, hung down by the fore-chains so low, as that with\\ngreat difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got\\nup into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was\\nbulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so\\non the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather earth, that her stern\\nlay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By\\nthis means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was\\ndry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what\\nwas spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found that all the ship s\\nprovisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well\\ndisposed to eat, I went to the bread room and filled my pockets with\\nbiscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to\\nlose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large\\ndram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was\\nbefore me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many\\nthings which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.\\n\\nIt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and\\nthis extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and\\ntwo or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the\\nship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of\\nthem overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with\\na rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done I went down\\nthe ship s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together\\nat both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two\\nor three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could\\nwalk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great\\nweight, the pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with a\\ncarpenter s saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added\\nthem to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of\\nfurnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I\\nshould have been able to have done upon another occasion.\\n\\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next\\ncare was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it\\nfrom the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this. I first\\nlaid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having\\nconsidered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen s chests,\\nwhich I had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon my\\nraft; the first of these I filled with provisions viz. bread, rice,\\nthree Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat s flesh (which we lived\\nmuch upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which had been\\nlaid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls\\nwere killed. There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my\\ngreat disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or\\nspoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several, cases of bottles\\nbelonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in\\nall, about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves,\\nthere being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.\\nWhile I was doing this, I found the tide begin to flow, though very\\ncalm; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,\\nwhich I had left on the shore, upon the sand, swim away. As for my\\nbreeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in\\nthem and my stockings. However, this set me on rummaging for clothes,\\nof which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present\\nuse, for I had others things which my eye was more upon as, first,\\ntools to work with on shore. And it was after long searching that I\\nfound out the carpenter s chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize\\nto me, and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have been\\nat that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing\\ntime to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.\\n\\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very good\\nfowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. These I secured\\nfirst, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old\\nrusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,\\nbut knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I\\nfound them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water. Those\\ntwo I got to my raft with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty\\nwell freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them,\\nhaving neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind\\nwould have overset all my navigation.\\n\\nI had three encouragements 1st, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide\\nrising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was\\nblew me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken\\noars belonging to the boat and, besides the tools which were in the\\nchest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer; with this cargo I put to\\nsea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that I\\nfound it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed\\nbefore; by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water,\\nand consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I\\nmight make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.\\n\\nAs I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening of\\nthe land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I\\nguided my raft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.\\n\\nBut here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I\\nhad, I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of\\nthe coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not\\nbeing aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my\\ncargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and to fallen\\ninto the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests,\\nto keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with\\nall my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but\\nholding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near\\nhalf-an-hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little\\nmore upon a level; and a little after, the water still-rising, my raft\\nfloated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the\\nchannel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the\\nmouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current\\nof tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to\\nshore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river: hoping\\nin time to see some ships at sea, and therefore resolved to place\\nmyself as near the coast as I could.\\n\\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to\\nwhich with great pain and difficulty I guided my raft, and at last got\\nso near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly\\nin. But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again;\\nfor that shore lying pretty steep that is to say sloping there was no\\nplace to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would\\nlie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would\\nendanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till the tide\\nwas at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to\\nhold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,\\nwhich I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I\\nfound water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water I thrust her\\nupon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by\\nsticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side near one\\nend, and one on the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till\\nthe water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.\\n\\nMy next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my\\nhabitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever\\nmight happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent or\\non an island; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of\\nwild beasts or not. There was a hill not above a mile from me, which\\nrose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other\\nhills, which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out one of the\\nfowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus\\narmed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where,\\nafter I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw my\\nfate, to my great affliction viz. that I was in an island environed\\nevery way with the sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay\\na great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which lay about\\nthree leagues to the west.\\n\\nI found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good\\nreason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however,\\nI saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds;\\nneither when I killed them could I tell what was fit for food, and what\\nnot. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon\\na tree on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that\\nhad been fired there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner\\nfired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable\\nnumber of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and crying,\\nand every one according to his usual note, but not one of them of any\\nkind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind\\nof hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or\\nclaws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.\\n\\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work\\nto bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day. What\\nto do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I\\nwas afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast\\nmight devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really no\\nneed for those fears.\\n\\nHowever, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chest\\nand boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that\\nnight s lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself,\\nexcept that I had seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the\\nwood where I shot the fowl.\\n\\nI now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of\\nthe ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the\\nrigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I\\nresolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And\\nas I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all\\nin pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I had got\\neverything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a\\ncouncil that is to say in my thoughts whether I should take back the\\nraft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before,\\nwhen the tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I\\nwent from my hut, having nothing on but my chequered shirt, a pair of\\nlinen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.\\n\\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and,\\nhaving had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy,\\nnor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very\\nuseful to me; as first, in the carpenters stores I found two or three\\nbags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of\\nhatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone.\\nAll these I secured, together with several things belonging to the\\ngunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket\\nbullets, seven muskets, another fowling-piece, with some small quantity\\nof powder more; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of\\nsheet-lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get\\nit over the ship s side.\\n\\nBesides these things, I took all the men s clothes that I could find,\\nand a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I\\nloaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very\\ngreat comfort.\\n\\nI was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land, that at\\nleast my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back I\\nfound no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat\\nupon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a\\nlittle distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and\\nunconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be\\nacquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but, as she did not\\nunderstand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer\\nto stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the\\nway, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however, I\\nspared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it,\\nand looked (as if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare\\nno more: so she marched off.\\n\\nHaving got my second cargo on shore though I was fain to open the\\nbarrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,\\nbeing large casks I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail\\nand some poles which I cut for that purpose: and into this tent I\\nbrought everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and\\nI piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,\\nto fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.\\n\\nWhen I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some\\nboards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading\\none of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head,\\nand my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept\\nvery quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night\\nbefore I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day to fetch\\nall those things from the ship, and to get them on shore.\\n\\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\\nbelieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship\\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of\\nher that I could; so every day at low water I went on board, and\\nbrought away something or other; but particularly the third time I went\\nI brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small\\nropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which\\nwas to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.\\nIn a word, I brought away all the sails, first and last; only that I\\nwas fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could,\\nfor they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.\\n\\nBut that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I\\nhad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with I say,\\nafter all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets\\nof rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this\\nwas surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more\\nprovisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the\\nhogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces\\nof the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on\\nshore also.\\n\\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship\\nof what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables.\\nCutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two\\ncables and a hawser on shore, with all the ironwork I could get; and\\nhaving cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything\\nI could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods,\\nand came away. But my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft\\nwas so unwieldy, and so overladen, that, after I had entered the little\\ncove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide\\nit so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my\\ncargo into the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was\\nnear the shore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost,\\nespecially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to\\nme; however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of the\\ncable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I\\nwas fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very\\nmuch. After this, I went every day on board, and brought away what I\\ncould get.\\n\\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on\\nboard the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of\\nhands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily,\\nhad the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship,\\npiece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found\\nthe wind began to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and\\nthough I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing\\nmore could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in\\none of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large\\nscissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks: in another\\nI found about thirty-six pounds value in money some European coin, some\\nBrazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.\\n\\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money:  O drug!  said I, aloud,\\n what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me no, not the taking\\noff the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap; I have no\\nmanner of use for thee e en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom\\nas a creature whose life is not worth saving.  However, upon second\\nthoughts I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I\\nbegan to think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this,\\nI found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter\\nof an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred\\nto me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind\\noffshore; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of\\nflood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.\\nAccordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the\\nchannel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with\\ndifficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me,\\nand partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily,\\nand before it was quite high water it blew a storm.\\n\\nBut I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth\\nabout me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in the morning,\\nwhen I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I was a little\\nsurprised, but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection that I\\nhad lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of\\nher that could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left\\nin her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.\\n\\nI now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of\\nher, except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed,\\ndivers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use\\nto me.\\n\\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against\\neither savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in\\nthe island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and\\nwhat kind of dwelling to make whether I should make me a cave in the\\nearth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both;\\nthe manner and description of which, it may not be improper to give an\\naccount of.\\n\\nI soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because\\nit was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it\\nwould not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was no\\nfresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more\\nconvenient spot of ground.\\n\\nI consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be\\nproper for me: 1st, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned;\\n2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous\\ncreatures, whether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God\\nsent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my\\ndeliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation\\nyet.\\n\\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the\\nside of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep\\nas a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.\\nOn the one side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way\\nin, like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any\\ncave or way into the rock at all.\\n\\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\\npitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and\\nabout twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the\\nend of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by\\nthe seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was\\nsheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun,\\nor thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.\\n\\nBefore I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,\\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\\ntwenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending.\\n\\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them\\ninto the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end\\nbeing out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on\\nthe top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\\n\\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid\\nthem in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two\\nrows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,\\nleaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a\\npost; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could\\nget into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour,\\nespecially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and\\ndrive them into the earth.\\n\\nThe entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a\\nshort ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted\\nover after me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I\\nthought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the\\nnight, which otherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared\\nafterwards, there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that\\nI apprehended danger from.\\n\\nInto this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my\\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have\\nthe account above; and I made a large tent, which to preserve me from\\nthe rains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made\\ndouble one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and\\ncovered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among\\nthe sails.\\n\\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on\\nshore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged\\nto the mate of the ship.\\n\\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would\\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\\nentrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,\\nas I said, by a short ladder.\\n\\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and\\nbringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent,\\nI laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it\\nraised the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a\\ncave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.\\n\\nIt cost me much labour and many days before all these things were\\nbrought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some other\\nthings which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,\\nafter I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the\\ncave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden\\nflash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as\\nis naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the\\nlightning as I was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift\\nas the lightning itself Oh, my powder! My very heart sank within me\\nwhen I thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on\\nwhich, not my defence only, but the providing my food, as I thought,\\nentirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger,\\nthough, had the powder took fire, I should never have known who had\\nhurt me.\\n\\nSuch impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over I\\nlaid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself\\nto make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little\\nand a little in a parcel, in the hope that, whatever might come, it\\nmight not all take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should\\nnot be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in\\nabout a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about two\\nhundred and forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred\\nparcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any\\ndanger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I\\ncalled my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the\\nrocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I\\nlaid it.\\n\\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least\\nevery day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I could\\nkill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself\\nwith what the island produced. The first time I went out, I presently\\ndiscovered that there were goats in the island, which was a great\\nsatisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to\\nme viz. that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it\\nwas the most difficult thing in the world to come at them; but I was\\nnot discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot\\none, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a little,\\nI laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw me in the\\nvalleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a\\nterrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was\\nupon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded\\nthat, by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed\\ndownward that they did not readily see objects that were above them; so\\nafterwards I took this method I always climbed the rocks first, to get\\nabove them, and then had frequently a fair mark.\\n\\nThe first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which\\nhad a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me\\nheartily; for when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her,\\ntill I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the\\nold one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my\\nenclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,\\nand carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it\\nwould not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself. These two\\nsupplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my\\nprovisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could.\\n\\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn: and what I did for\\nthat, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\\nshall give a full account of in its place; but I must now give some\\nlittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it\\nmay well be supposed, were not a few.\\n\\nI had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away\\nupon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm,\\nquite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.\\nsome hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of\\nmankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of\\nHeaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I\\nshould end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I\\nmade these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself\\nwhy Providence should thus completely ruin His creatures, and render\\nthem so absolutely miserable; so without help, abandoned, so entirely\\ndepressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a\\nlife.\\n\\nBut something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,\\nand to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my\\nhand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\\ncondition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,\\nthus:  Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray\\nremember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come, eleven of you in\\nthe boat? Where are the ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why\\nwere you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?  And then I\\npointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that\\nis in them, and with what worse attends them.\\n\\nThen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\\nsubsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened\\n(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the\\nplace where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore that\\nI had time to get all these things out of her; what would have been my\\ncase, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at\\nfirst came on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to\\nsupply and procure them?  Particularly,  said I, aloud (though to\\nmyself),  what should I have done without a gun, without ammunition,\\nwithout any tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes,\\nbedding, a tent, or any manner of covering?  and that now I had all\\nthese to sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself\\nin such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was\\nspent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want,\\nas long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I would\\nprovide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time that was\\nto come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even\\nafter my health and strength should decay.\\n\\nI confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\\ndestroyed at one blast I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;\\nand this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened\\nand thundered, as I observed just now.\\n\\nAnd now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of\\nsilent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before,\\nI shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It\\nwas by my account the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above\\nsaid, I first set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to\\nus in its autumnal equinox, was almost over my head; for I reckoned\\nmyself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees\\ntwenty-two minutes north of the line.\\n\\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my\\nthoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and\\npen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent\\nthis, I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters and\\nmaking it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first\\nlanded I came on shore here on the 30th September 1659. \\n\\nUpon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my\\nknife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every\\nfirst day of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept\\nmy calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.\\n\\nIn the next place, we are to observe that among the many things which I\\nbrought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above\\nmentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at\\nall less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as, in\\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain s,\\nmate s, gunner s and carpenter s keeping; three or four compasses, some\\nmathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of\\nnavigation, all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or\\nno; also, I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo\\nfrom England, and which I had packed up among my things; some\\nPortuguese books also; and among them two or three Popish prayer-books,\\nand several other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not\\nforget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent\\nhistory I may have occasion to say something in its place; for I\\ncarried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the\\nship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore\\nwith my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years; I\\nwanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could\\nmake up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not\\ndo. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded\\nthem to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept\\nthings very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not\\nmake any ink by any means that I could devise.\\n\\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things notwithstanding all\\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a\\nspade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,\\nand thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near\\na whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or\\nsurrounded my habitation. The piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as\\nI could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the\\nwoods, and more, by far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes\\ntwo days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third\\nday in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy\\npiece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron\\ncrows; which, however, though I found it, made driving those posts or\\npiles very laborious and tedious work.\\n\\n\\nBut what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I\\nhad to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other\\nemployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee,\\nexcept the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or\\nless, every day.\\n\\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I\\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not\\nso much to leave them to any that were to come after me for I was\\nlikely to have but few heirs as to deliver my thoughts from daily\\nporing over them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to\\nmaster my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could,\\nand to set the good against the evil, that I might have something to\\ndistinguish my case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like\\ndebtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I\\nsuffered, thus: \\n\\n\\n_Evil_.\\n\\n\\n_Good_.\\n\\n\\nI am cast upon a horrible, desolate island, void of all hope of\\nrecovery.\\n\\n\\nBut I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship s company were.\\n\\n\\nI am singled out and separated, as it were, from all the world, to be\\nmiserable.\\n\\n\\nBut I am singled out, too, from all the ship s crew, to be spared from\\ndeath; and He that miraculously saved me from death can deliver me from\\nthis condition.\\n\\n\\nI am divided from mankind a solitaire; one banished from human society.\\n\\n\\nBut I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place, affording no\\nsustenance.\\n\\n\\nI have no clothes to cover me.\\n\\n\\nBut I am in a hot climate, where, if I had clothes, I could hardly wear\\nthem.\\n\\n\\nI am without any defence, or means to resist any violence of man or\\nbeast.\\n\\n\\nBut I am cast on an island where I see no wild beasts to hurt me, as I\\nsaw on the coast of Africa; and what if I had been shipwrecked there?\\n\\n\\nI have no soul to speak to or relieve me.\\n\\n\\nBut God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the shore, that I\\nhave got out as many necessary things as will either supply my wants or\\nenable me to supply myself, even as long as I live.\\n\\n\\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce\\nany condition in the world so miserable but there was something\\nnegative or something positive to be thankful for in it; and let this\\nstand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all\\nconditions in this world: that we may always find in it something to\\ncomfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and\\nevil, on the credit side of the account.\\n\\nHaving now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship I say, giving\\nover these things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living,\\nand to make things as easy to me as I could.\\n\\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\\nof a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables: but I\\nmight now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against\\nit of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside; and after some time\\n(I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to\\nthe rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such\\nthings as I could get, to keep out the rain; which I found at some\\ntimes of the year very violent.\\n\\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\\ninto the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that\\nat first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no\\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I\\nset myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it\\nwas a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed\\non it: and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I\\nworked sideways, to the right hand, into the rock; and then, turning to\\nthe right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on\\nthe outside of my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress\\nand regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but\\ngave me room to store my goods.\\n\\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I\\nfound I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without\\nthese I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I\\ncould not write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure\\nwithout a table: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that\\nas reason is the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating\\nand squaring everything by reason, and by making the most rational\\njudgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic\\nart. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by\\nlabour, application, and contrivance, I found at last that I wanted\\nnothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools.\\nHowever, I made abundance of things, even without tools; and some with\\nno more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made\\nthat way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I\\nwanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an\\nedge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I\\nbrought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze.\\nIt is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole\\ntree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had\\nfor the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make\\na plank or board: but my time or labour was little worth, and so it was\\nas well employed one way as another.\\n\\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the\\nfirst place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I\\nbrought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out some\\nboards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a\\nhalf, one over another all along one side of my cave, to lay all my\\ntools, nails and ironwork on; and, in a word, to separate everything at\\nlarge into their places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked\\npieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that\\nwould hang up; so that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a\\ngeneral magazine of all necessary things; and had everything so ready\\nat my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in\\nsuch order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so\\ngreat.\\n\\nAnd now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day s\\nemployment; for, indeed, at first I was in too much hurry, and not only\\nhurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind; and my\\njournal would have been full of many dull things; for example, I must\\nhave said thus:  30_th_. After I had got to shore, and escaped\\ndrowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having\\nfirst vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which had got into\\nmy stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore\\nwringing my hands and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my\\nmisery, and crying out,  I was undone, undone!  till, tired and faint,\\nI was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep\\nfor fear of being devoured. \\n\\nSome days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got\\nall that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the\\ntop of a little mountain and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a\\nship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please myself with\\nthe hopes of it, and then after looking steadily, till I was almost\\nblind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus\\nincrease my misery by my folly.\\n\\nBut having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled\\nmy household staff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all\\nas handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal; of which I\\nshall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these\\nparticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I\\nwas forced to leave it off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. BUILDS A HOUSE THE JOURNAL\\n\\n\\nSeptember 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being\\nshipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on\\nthis dismal, unfortunate island, which I called  The Island of\\nDespair ; all the rest of the ship s company being drowned, and myself\\nalmost dead.\\n\\nAll the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal\\ncircumstances I was brought to viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,\\nweapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing\\nbut death before me either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,\\nmurdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the\\napproach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but\\nslept soundly, though it rained all night.\\n\\n_October_ 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had\\nfloated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer\\nthe island; which, as it was some comfort, on one hand for, seeing her\\nset upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I\\nmight get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my\\nrelief so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my\\ncomrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have\\nsaved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned\\nas they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have\\nbuilt us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some\\nother part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing\\nmyself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I\\nwent upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day\\nalso it continued raining, though with no wind at all.\\n\\n_From the 1st of October to the 24th_. All these days entirely spent in\\nmany several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I\\nbrought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also in the\\ndays, though with some intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was\\nthe rainy season.\\n\\n_Oct._ 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but,\\nbeing in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered\\nmany of them when the tide was out.\\n\\n_Oct._ 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;\\nduring which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little\\nharder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of\\nher, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and\\nsecuring the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil\\nthem.\\n\\n_Oct._ 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place\\nto fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any\\nattack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I\\nfixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle\\nfor my encampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or\\nfortification, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and\\nwithout with turf.\\n\\nFrom the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my goods\\nto my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained\\nexceedingly hard.\\n\\nThe 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to\\nseek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat,\\nand her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because\\nit would not feed.\\n\\n_November_ 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the\\nfirst night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to\\nswing my hammock upon.\\n\\n_Nov._ 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber\\nwhich made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little\\nwithin the place I had marked out for my fortification.\\n\\n_Nov._ 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks,\\nwhich were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a\\ntable.\\n\\n_Nov_. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out\\nwith my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion viz. every morning I\\nwalked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then\\nemployed myself to work till about eleven o clock; then eat what I had\\nto live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather\\nbeing excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The\\nworking part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making\\nmy table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and\\nnecessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe\\nthey would do any one else.\\n\\n_Nov._ 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a\\nwild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every\\ncreature that I killed I took of the skins and preserved them. Coming\\nback by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not\\nunderstand; but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three\\nseals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,\\ngot into the sea, and escaped me for that time.\\n\\n_Nov._ 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my table again, and\\nfinished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned\\nto mend it.\\n\\n_Nov._ 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,\\n10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up\\nto make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape,\\nbut never to please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces\\nseveral times.\\n\\n_Note_. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for\\nthem on my post, I forgot which was which.\\n\\n_Nov._ 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and\\ncooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and\\nlightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As\\nsoon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as\\nmany little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.\\n\\n_Nov._ 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little square\\nchests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at\\nmost, of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places\\nas secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these\\nthree days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not\\nwhat to call it.\\n\\n_Nov._ 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to\\nmake room for my further conveniency.\\n\\n_Note_. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work viz. a pickaxe,\\na shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and\\nbegan to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As\\nfor the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper\\nenough, though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this\\nwas so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing\\neffectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.\\n\\n_Nov._ 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that\\nwood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its\\nexceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my\\naxe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,\\nfor it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my\\nhaving no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I\\nworked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or\\nspade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the\\nboard part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me\\nso long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had\\noccasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after\\nthat fashion, or so long in making.\\n\\nI was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A basket\\nI could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that\\nwould bend to make wicker-ware at least, none yet found out; and as to\\na wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had\\nno notion of; neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no\\npossible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the\\nwheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth\\nwhich I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the\\nlabourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not\\nso difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the\\nshovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,\\ntook me up no less than four days I mean always excepting my morning\\nwalk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also\\nbringing home something fit to eat.\\n\\n_Nov._ 23. My other work having now stood still, because of my making\\nthese tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day,\\nas my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in\\nwidening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods\\ncommodiously.\\n\\n_Note_. During all this time I worked to make this room or cave\\nspacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a\\nkitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the\\ntent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained\\nso hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to\\ncover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of\\nrafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large\\nleaves of trees, like a thatch.\\n\\n_December_ 10. I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on\\na sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth\\nfell down from the top on one side; so much that, in short, it frighted\\nme, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had\\nnever wanted a gravedigger. I had now a great deal of work to do over\\nagain, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more\\nimportance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no\\nmore would come down.\\n\\n_Dec_. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two\\nshores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards\\nacross over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more\\nposts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured, and\\nthe posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off the\\nhouse.\\n\\n_Dec._ 17. From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up\\nnails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up; and\\nnow I began to be in some order within doors.\\n\\n_Dec._ 20. Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish\\nmy house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my\\nvictuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made\\nme another table.\\n\\n_Dec._ 24. Much rain all night and all day. No stirring out.\\n\\n_Dec._ 25. Rain all day.\\n\\n_Dec._ 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and\\npleasanter.\\n\\n_Dec._ 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught it\\nand led it home in a string; when I had it at home, I bound and\\nsplintered up its leg, which was broke.\\n\\n_N.B._ I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and\\nas strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed\\nupon the little green at my door, and would not go away. This was the\\nfirst time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame\\ncreatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was all\\nspent.\\n\\n_Dec._ 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no\\nstirring abroad except in the evening for food; this time I spent in\\nputting all my things in order within doors.\\n\\n_January_ 1. Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my\\ngun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going\\nfarther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I\\nfound there were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to\\ncome at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt\\nthem down.\\n\\n_Jan._ 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him\\nupon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the\\ndog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.\\n\\n_Jan._ 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my\\nbeing attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.\\n\\n_N.B._ This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said\\nin the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time\\nthan from the 2nd of January to the 14th of April working, finishing,\\nand perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about twenty-four\\nyards in length, being a half-circle from one place in the rock to\\nanother place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in\\nthe centre behind it.\\n\\nAll this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days,\\nnay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never be\\nperfectly secure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible\\nwhat inexpressible labour everything was done with, especially the\\nbringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground; for I\\nmade them much bigger than I needed to have done.\\n\\nWhen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with a turf\\nwall raised up close to it, I perceived myself that if any people were\\nto come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a\\nhabitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed\\nhereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.\\n\\nDuring this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when\\nthe rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of\\nsomething or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of\\nwild pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as\\nhouse-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I\\nendeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older\\nthey flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them,\\nfor I had nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their\\nnests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat. And now, in\\nthe managing my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many\\nthings, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as,\\nindeed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could never make a\\ncask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before;\\nbut I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though\\nI spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join\\nthe staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave\\nthat also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles;\\nso that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven\\no clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax\\nwith which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of\\nthat now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I\\nsaved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in\\nthe sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and\\nthis gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle. In\\nthe middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I\\nfound a little bag which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn\\nfor the feeding of poultry not for this voyage, but before, as I\\nsuppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn\\nthat had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw\\nnothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the\\nbag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided\\nit for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of\\ncorn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.\\n\\nIt was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw\\nthis stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that\\nI had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts,\\nI saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,\\nwhich I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was\\nsurprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,\\nI saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green\\nbarley, of the same kind as our European nay, as our English barley.\\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my\\nthoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious\\nfoundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my\\nhead, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me\\notherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God,\\nwithout so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these\\nthings, or His order in governing events for the world. But after I saw\\nbarley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,\\nand especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me\\nstrangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His\\ngrain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so\\ndirected purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.\\n\\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I\\nbegan to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon\\nmy account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it\\nstill, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,\\nwhich proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen\\nit grow in Africa when I was ashore there.\\n\\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my\\nsupport, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all\\nover that part of the island, where I had been before, peering in every\\ncorner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not\\nfind any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I shook a bag of\\nchickens  meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease;\\nand I must confess my religious thankfulness to God s providence began\\nto abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what\\nwas common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and\\nunforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really\\nthe work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or\\ntwelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had\\ndestroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also,\\nthat I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in\\nthe shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had\\nthrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been burnt up and\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their\\nseason, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I\\nresolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity\\nsufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year\\nthat I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even\\nthen but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost\\nall that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for\\nI sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all,\\nat least not as it would have done; of which in its place.\\n\\nBesides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of\\nrice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to\\nthe same purpose to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to\\ncook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.\\n\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\n\\nI worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;\\nand the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by\\na door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on\\nthe outside of my habitation.\\n\\n_April_ 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,\\nand then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside. This was\\na complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing\\ncould come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.\\n\\nThe very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had all my\\nlabour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus: As I\\nwas busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my\\ncave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful, surprising thing\\nindeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from\\nthe roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and\\ntwo of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful\\nmanner. I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was really\\nthe cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some\\nof it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it I ran\\nforward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got\\nover my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might\\nroll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,\\nthan I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood\\non shook three times at about eight minutes  distance, with three such\\nshocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be\\nsupposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a\\nrock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with\\nsuch a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also\\nthe very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the\\nshocks were stronger under the water than on the island.\\n\\nI was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,\\nnor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or\\nstupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one\\nthat was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock\\nawakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I\\nwas in, filled me with horror; and I thought of nothing then but the\\nhill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all\\nat once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.\\n\\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I\\nbegan to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my\\nwall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the\\nground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All\\nthis while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but\\nthe common  Lord have mercy upon me!  and when it was over that went\\naway too.\\n\\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it\\nwould rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so\\nthat in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the\\nsea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was\\ncovered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the\\nroots, and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and\\nthen began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began\\nto rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground very much\\nterrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that\\nthese winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the\\nearthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave\\nagain. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also\\nhelping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain\\nwas so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I\\nwas forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for\\nfear it should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new\\nwork viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to\\nlet the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave. After I\\nhad been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of\\nthe earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now, to support\\nmy spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little\\nstore, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and\\nalways very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.\\nIt continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so\\nthat I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began\\nto think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was\\nsubject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a\\ncave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place\\nwhich I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make\\nmyself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed\\nwhere I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.\\n\\nWith these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where\\nit stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and\\nwhich, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent;\\nand I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in\\ncontriving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being\\nswallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the\\napprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it;\\nbut still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in\\norder, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it\\nmade me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that\\nit would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must\\nbe contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for\\nmyself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this\\nresolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go\\nto work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c.,\\nin a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished;\\nbut that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and\\nfit to remove. This was the 21st.\\n\\n_April_ 22. The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this\\nresolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools. I had\\nthree large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the\\nhatchets for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and\\ncutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and\\nthough I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.\\nThis cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a\\ngrand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.\\nAt length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot,\\nthat I might have both my hands at liberty. _Note_. I had never seen\\nany such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was\\ndone, though since I have observed, it is very common there; besides\\nthat, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a\\nfull week s work to bring it to perfection.\\n\\n_April_ 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my\\nmachine for turning my grindstone performing very well.\\n\\n_April_ 30. Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I\\ntook a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day,\\nwhich made my heart very heavy.\\n\\n_May_ 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the tide being\\nlow, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it\\nlooked like a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two\\nor three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by\\nthe late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it\\nseemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined\\nthe barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of\\ngunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as\\na stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and\\nwent on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to\\nlook for more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. ILL AND CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN\\n\\n\\nWhen I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed. The\\nforecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six\\nfeet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and parted from the rest\\nby the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was\\ntossed as it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so\\nhigh on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place\\nof water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of\\nthe wreck without swimming I could now walk quite up to her when the\\ntide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it\\nmust be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was\\nmore broke open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore,\\nwhich the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by\\ndegrees to the land.\\n\\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my\\nhabitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in\\nsearching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found\\nnothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship\\nwas choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of\\nanything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of the\\nship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be of some\\nuse or other to me.\\n\\n_May_ 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which\\nI thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and\\nwhen I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could\\nfrom the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged\\nto give over for that time.\\n\\n_May_ 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of,\\ntill I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a\\nyoung dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had\\nno hooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to\\neat; all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.\\n\\n_May_ 5. Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought\\nthree great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and\\nmade to float on shore when the tide of flood came on.\\n\\n_May_ 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her and\\nother pieces of ironwork. Worked very hard, and came home very much\\ntired, and had thoughts of giving it over.\\n\\n_May_ 7. Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but found\\nthe weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut;\\nthat several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of\\nthe hold lay so open that I could see into it; but it was almost full\\nof water and sand.\\n\\n_May_ 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the\\ndeck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open\\ntwo planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the\\niron crow in the wreck for next day.\\n\\n_May_ 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of\\nthe wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but\\ncould not break them up. I felt also a roll of English lead, and could\\nstir it, but it was too heavy to remove.\\n\\n_May_ 10 14. Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces\\nof timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight of\\niron.\\n\\n_May_ 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off\\nthe roll of lead by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with\\nthe other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could\\nnot make any blow to drive the hatchet.\\n\\n_May_ 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more\\nbroken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to\\nget pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck\\nthat day.\\n\\n_May_ 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great\\ndistance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were,\\nand found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring\\naway.\\n\\n_May_ 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard\\nlabour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first\\nflowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen s chests;\\nbut the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but\\npieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but\\nthe salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every\\nday to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I\\nalways appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the\\ntide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this\\ntime I had got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a\\ngood boat, if I had known how; and also I got, at several times and in\\nseveral pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.\\n\\n_June_ 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise or\\nturtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my\\nmisfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I\\nhappened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had\\nhundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid\\ndear enough for them.\\n\\n_June_ 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three-score\\neggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and\\npleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of\\ngoats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.\\n\\n_June_ 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at this time\\nthe rain felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not\\nusual in that latitude.\\n\\n_June_ 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.\\n\\n_June_ 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.\\n\\n_June_ 21. Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of\\nmy sad condition to be sick, and no help. Prayed to God, for the first\\ntime since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my\\nthoughts being all confused.\\n\\n_June_ 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of\\nsickness.\\n\\n_June_ 23. Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent\\nheadache.\\n\\n_June_ 24. Much better.\\n\\n_June_ 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold fit\\nand hot, with faint sweats after it.\\n\\n_June_ 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but\\nfound myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and with much\\ndifficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate, I would fain\\nhave stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.\\n\\n_June_ 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and\\nneither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I\\nhad not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.\\nPrayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so\\nignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried,  Lord, look\\nupon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!  I suppose I did\\nnothing else for two or three hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell\\nasleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found\\nmyself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I\\nhad no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and\\nwent to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I\\nthought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall,\\nwhere I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a\\nman descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and\\nlight upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I\\ncould but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most\\ninexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he\\nstepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,\\njust as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked,\\nto my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He\\nwas no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me,\\nwith a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came\\nto a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me or I heard a voice\\nso terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that\\nI can say I understood was this:  Seeing all these things have not\\nbrought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;  at which words, I\\nthought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.\\n\\nNo one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be\\nable to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. I\\nmean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors.\\nNor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained\\nupon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.\\n\\nI had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the good\\ninstruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series,\\nfor eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation\\nwith none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last\\ndegree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought\\nthat so much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or\\ninwards towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity\\nof soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely\\noverwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,\\nwicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not\\nhaving the least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of\\nthankfulness to God in deliverance.\\n\\nIn the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more\\neasily believed when I shall add, that through all the variety of\\nmiseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one\\nthought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment\\nfor my sin my rebellious behaviour against my father or my present\\nsins, which were great or so much as a punishment for the general\\ncourse of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the\\ndesert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what\\nwould become of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither I should\\ngo, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as\\nwell from voracious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely\\nthoughtless of a God or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the\\nprinciples of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and,\\nindeed, hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the\\nPortugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as\\nwell as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts.\\nWhen, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on\\nthis island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment.\\nI only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to\\nbe always miserable.\\n\\nIt is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship s\\ncrew drowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy,\\nand some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted,\\nmight have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began,\\nin a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was\\nalive, without the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of\\nthe hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved\\nwhen all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been\\nthus merciful unto me. Even just the same common sort of joy which\\nseamen generally have, after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck,\\nwhich they drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as\\nsoon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it. Even when\\nI was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of my condition,\\nhow I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,\\nout of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw\\nbut a prospect of living and that I should not starve and perish for\\nhunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began to be very\\neasy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and\\nsupply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a\\njudgment from heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were\\nthoughts which very seldom entered my head.\\n\\nThe growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first\\nsome little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness,\\nas long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as\\never that part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was\\nraised from it wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the\\nearthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or\\nmore immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs\\nsuch things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the\\nimpression it had made went off also. I had no more sense of God or His\\njudgments much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being\\nfrom His hand than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of\\nlife. But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the\\nmiseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began\\nto sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was\\nexhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so\\nlong, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life,\\nin which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the\\njustice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in\\nso vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second\\nor third day of my distemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever\\nas of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words\\nfrom me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a\\nprayer attended with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of\\nmere fright and distress. My thoughts were confused, the convictions\\ngreat upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable\\ncondition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; and\\nin these hurries of my soul I knew not what my tongue might express.\\nBut it was rather exclamation, such as,  Lord, what a miserable\\ncreature am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of\\nhelp; and what will become of me!  Then the tears burst out of my eyes,\\nand I could say no more for a good while. In this interval the good\\nadvice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction,\\nwhich I mentioned at the beginning of this story viz. that if I did\\ntake this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have\\nleisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when\\nthere might be none to assist in my recovery.  Now,  said I, aloud,  my\\ndear father s words are come to pass; God s justice has overtaken me,\\nand I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,\\nwhich had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I\\nmight have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself nor\\nlearn to know the blessing of it from my parents. I left them to mourn\\nover my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it.\\nI abused their help and assistance, who would have lifted me in the\\nworld, and would have made everything easy to me; and now I have\\ndifficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to\\nsupport, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.  Then I\\ncried out,  Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress.  This was the\\nfirst prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years.\\n\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\n\\n_June_ 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and\\nthe fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror\\nof my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague\\nwould return again the next day, and now was my time to get something\\nto refresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing\\nI did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon\\nmy table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish\\ndisposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into\\nit, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat s flesh\\nand broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about,\\nbut was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense\\nof my miserable condition, dreading, the return of my distemper the\\nnext day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle s eggs,\\nwhich I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, and\\nthis was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God s blessing to, that\\nI could remember, in my whole life. After I had eaten I tried to walk,\\nbut found myself so weak that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never\\nwent out without that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon\\nthe ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and\\nvery calm and smooth. As I sat here some such thoughts as these\\noccurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so\\nmuch? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other creatures\\nwild and tame, human and brutal? Whence are we? Sure we are all made by\\nsome secret Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And\\nwho is that? Then it followed most naturally, it is God that has made\\nall. Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these\\nthings, He guides and governs them all, and all things that concern\\nthem; for the Power that could make all things must certainly have\\npower to guide and direct them. If so, nothing can happen in the great\\ncircuit of His works, either without His knowledge or appointment.\\n\\nAnd if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here,\\nand am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His\\nappointment, He has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred\\nto my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it\\nrested upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that God\\nhad appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought into this\\nmiserable circumstance by His direction, He having the sole power, not\\nof me only, but of everything that happened in the world. Immediately\\nit followed: Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus\\nused? My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had\\nblasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice:  Wretch! dost\\n_thou_ ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent\\nlife, and ask thyself what thou hast _not_ done? Ask, why is it that\\nthou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth\\nRoads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee\\nman-of-war; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or\\ndrowned _here_, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost _thou_\\nask, what have I done?  I was struck dumb with these reflections, as\\none astonished, and had not a word to say no, not to answer to myself,\\nbut rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up\\nover my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly\\ndisturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my\\nchair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the\\napprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it\\noccurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their\\ntobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of\\ntobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that\\nwas green, and not quite cured.\\n\\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure\\nboth for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked\\nfor, the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I\\ntook out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this\\ntime I had not found leisure or inclination to look into. I say, I took\\nit out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.\\nWhat use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether\\nit was good for it or no: but I tried several experiments with it, as\\nif I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece\\nof leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost\\nstupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had\\nnot been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two\\nin some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and\\nlastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over\\nthe smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as\\nalmost for suffocation. In the interval of this operation I took up the\\nBible and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the\\ntobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the\\nbook casually, the first words that occurred to me were these,  Call on\\nMe in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt\\nglorify Me.  These words were very apt to my case, and made some\\nimpression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so\\nmuch as they did afterwards; for, as for being _delivered_, the word\\nhad no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so\\nimpossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the\\nchildren of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat,  Can God\\nspread a table in the wilderness?  so I began to say,  Can God Himself\\ndeliver me from this place?  And as it was not for many years that any\\nhopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but,\\nhowever, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon\\nthem very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,\\ndozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp\\nburning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went\\nto bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my\\nlife I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me,\\nthat if I called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me.\\nAfter my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which\\nI had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco\\nthat I could scarcely get it down; immediately upon this I went to bed.\\nI found presently it flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a\\nsound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be\\nnear three o clock in the afternoon the next day nay, to this hour I am\\npartly of opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till\\nalmost three the day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose\\na day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some\\nyears after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing\\nthe line, I should have lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a\\nday in my account, and never knew which way. Be that, however, one way\\nor the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and\\nmy spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was\\nthe day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short,\\nI had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better.\\nThis was the 29th.\\n\\nThe 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but\\ndid not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something\\nlike a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to\\neat them; so I ate some more of the turtle s eggs, which were very\\ngood. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me\\ngood the day before the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so\\nmuch as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over\\nthe smoke; however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first\\nof July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the\\ncold fit, but it was not much.\\n\\n_July_ 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself\\nwith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.\\n\\n_July_ 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover\\nmy full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering\\nstrength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture,  I will\\ndeliver thee ; and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my\\nmind, in bar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself\\nwith such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my\\ndeliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the\\ndeliverance I had received, and I was as it were made to ask myself\\nsuch questions as these viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully\\ntoo, from sickness from the most distressed condition that could be,\\nand that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? Had\\nI done my part? God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him that\\nis to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance;\\nand how could I expect greater deliverance? This touched my heart very\\nmuch; and immediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my\\nrecovery from my sickness.\\n\\n_July_ 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New\\nTestament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to\\nread a while every morning and every night; not tying myself to the\\nnumber of chapters, but long as my thoughts should engage me. It was\\nnot long after I set seriously to this work till I found my heart more\\ndeeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The\\nimpression of my dream revived; and the words,  All these things have\\nnot brought thee to repentance,  ran seriously through my thoughts. I\\nwas earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened\\nprovidentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to\\nthese words:  He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance\\nand to give remission.  I threw down the book; and with my heart as\\nwell as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I\\ncried out aloud,  Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince\\nand Saviour! give me repentance!  This was the first time I could say,\\nin the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I\\nprayed with a sense of my condition, and a true Scripture view of hope,\\nfounded on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I\\nmay say, I began to hope that God would hear me.\\n\\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above,  Call on Me, and I\\nwill deliver thee,  in a different sense from what I had ever done\\nbefore; for then I had no notion of anything being called\\n_deliverance_, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for\\nthough I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly\\na prison to me, and that in the worse sense in the world. But now I\\nlearned to take it in another sense: now I looked back upon my past\\nlife with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul\\nsought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore\\ndown all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing. I did not\\nso much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of\\nno consideration in comparison to this. And I add this part here, to\\nhint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense\\nof things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing\\nthan deliverance from affliction.\\n\\nBut, leaving this part, I return to my Journal.\\n\\nMy condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of\\nliving, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by\\na constant reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a\\nhigher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which till now I\\nknew nothing of; also, my health and strength returned, I bestirred\\nmyself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way\\nof living as regular as I could.\\n\\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walking\\nabout with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man\\nthat was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is\\nhardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was\\nreduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and\\nperhaps which had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend\\nit to any to practise, by this experiment: and though it did carry off\\nthe fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent\\nconvulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time. I learned from it\\nalso this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the\\nmost pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those\\nrains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as\\nthe rain which came in the dry season was almost always accompanied\\nwith such storms, so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the\\nrain which fell in September and October.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE\\n\\n\\nI had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All possibility\\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;\\nand I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that\\nplace. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my\\nmind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the\\nisland, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet\\nknew nothing of.\\n\\nIt was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular\\nsurvey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I\\nhinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found after I came about two\\nmiles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no\\nmore than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but\\nthis being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of\\nit at least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be\\nperceived. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs\\nor meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising\\nparts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be\\nsupposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and\\ngrowing to a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other\\nplants, which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might,\\nperhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I\\nsearched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate,\\nmake their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of\\naloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but\\nwild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with\\nthese discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what\\ncourse I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the\\nfruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no\\nconclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was\\nin the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at\\nleast, very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress.\\n\\nThe next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after\\ngoing something further than I had gone the day before, I found the\\nbrook and the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than\\nbefore. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found\\nmelons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.\\nThe vines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of\\ngrapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a\\nsurprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was\\nwarned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when\\nI was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our\\nEnglishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and\\nfevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to\\ncure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins\\nare kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and\\nagreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.\\n\\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from\\nhome. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree,\\nwhere I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery;\\ntravelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the\\nvalley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and\\nnorth side of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening where\\nthe country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh\\nwater, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other\\nway, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so\\nflourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of\\nspring that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on\\nthe side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of\\npleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that\\nthis was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country\\nindefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it,\\nI might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in\\nEngland. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and\\ncitron trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least\\nnot then. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only\\npleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards\\nwith water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.\\nI found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I\\nresolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to\\nfurnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. In\\norder to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a\\nlesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in\\nanother place; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled homewards;\\nresolving to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,\\nto carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in this\\njourney, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but\\nbefore I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit\\nand the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them, they\\nwere good for little or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I\\ncould bring but a few.\\n\\nThe next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two\\nsmall bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming\\nto my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them,\\nto find them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some\\nhere, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded\\nthere were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but\\nwhat they were I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them\\nup on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they\\nwould be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their\\nown weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of\\nthe grapes, and hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they\\nmight cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I\\ncarried as many back as I could well stand under.\\n\\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\\nthe security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and\\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by\\nfar the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider\\nof removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as\\nwhere now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part\\nof the island.\\n\\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for\\nsome time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came\\nto a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside,\\nwhere it was at least possible that something might happen to my\\nadvantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring\\nsome other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce\\nprobable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself\\namong the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate\\nmy bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but\\nimpossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.\\nHowever, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time\\nthere for the whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and\\nthough upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a\\nlittle kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong\\nfence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and\\nfilled between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes\\ntwo or three nights together; always going over it with a ladder; so\\nthat I fancied now I had my country house and my sea-coast house; and\\nthis work took me up to the beginning of August.\\n\\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when\\nthe rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for\\nthough I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and\\nspread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me\\nfrom storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were\\nextraordinary.\\n\\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and\\nbegan to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung\\nup perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the\\nsun; so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy\\nthat I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,\\nand I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two\\nhundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and\\ncarried the most of them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and\\nfrom hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less,\\nevery day till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that\\nI could not stir out of my cave for several days.\\n\\nIn this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I\\nhad been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from\\nme, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her\\ntill, to my astonishment, she came home about the end of August with\\nthree kittens. This was the more strange to me because, though I had\\nkilled a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was\\nquite a different kind from our European cats; but the young cats were\\nthe same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being\\nfemales, I thought it very strange. But from these three cats I\\nafterwards came to be so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill\\nthem like vermin or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as\\nmuch as possible.\\n\\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could\\nnot stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this\\nconfinement, I began to be straitened for food: but venturing out\\ntwice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th,\\nfound a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was\\nregulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of\\nthe goat s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled for, to my\\ngreat misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or\\nthree of the turtle s eggs for my supper.\\n\\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or\\nthree hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards\\none side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or\\nway out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out\\nthis way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had\\nmanaged myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I\\nthought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and\\nyet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the\\nbiggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.\\n\\n_Sept._ 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing. I\\ncast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three\\nhundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting\\nit apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\\nHis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me\\nthrough Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for\\ntwelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a\\nbiscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day\\nas I began it. I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at\\nfirst I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,\\nomitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than\\nordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of\\nthe days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had\\nbeen there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every\\nseventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I\\nhad lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink\\nbegan to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly,\\nand to write down only the most remarkable events of my life, without\\ncontinuing a daily memorandum of other things.\\n\\nThe rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,\\nand I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but\\nI bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to\\nrelate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.\\n\\nI have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice,\\nwhich I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of\\nthemselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and\\nabout twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it,\\nafter the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me.\\nAccordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my\\nwooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as\\nI was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow\\nit all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for\\nit, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of\\neach. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not\\none grain of what I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry\\nmonths following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown,\\nit had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till\\nthe wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but\\nnewly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined\\nwas by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make\\nanother trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and\\nsowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal\\nequinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water\\nit, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having\\npart of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had\\nbut a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half\\na peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of my\\nbusiness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that\\nI might expect two seed-times and two harvests every year.\\n\\nWhile this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use\\nto me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began\\nto settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the\\ncountry to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I\\nfound all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I\\nhad made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut\\nout of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown\\nwith long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first\\nyear after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to call it that\\nthese stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased,\\nto see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow\\nas much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a\\nfigure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a\\ncircle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such\\nI might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade,\\nsufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to\\ncut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle\\nround my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; and\\nplacing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards\\ndistance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a\\nfine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also,\\nas I shall observe in its order.\\n\\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided,\\nnot into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons\\nand the dry seasons, which were generally thus: The half of February,\\nthe whole of March, and the half of April rainy, the sun being then on\\nor near the equinox.\\n\\nThe half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of\\nAugust dry, the sun being then to the north of the line.\\n\\nThe half of August, the whole of September, and the half of\\nOctober rainy, the sun being then come back.\\n\\nThe half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and\\nthe half of February dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.\\n\\nThe rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds\\nhappened to blow, but this was the general observation I made. After I\\nhad found by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the\\nrain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I\\nmight not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as\\npossible during the wet months. This time I found much employment, and\\nvery suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for many\\nthings which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and\\nconstant application; particularly I tried many ways to make myself a\\nbasket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle\\nthat they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now,\\nthat when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a\\nbasket-maker s, in the town where my father lived, to see them make\\ntheir wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to\\nhelp, and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those\\nthings, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full\\nknowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials,\\nwhen it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut\\nmy stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows,\\nand osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day\\nI went to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some of the\\nsmaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire;\\nwhereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a\\nquantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These\\nI set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for\\nuse I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I\\nemployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets,\\nboth to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion;\\nand though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them\\nsufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care\\nnever to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more,\\nespecially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks,\\nwhen I should come to have any quantity of it.\\n\\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,\\nI bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I had\\nno vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which\\nwere almost full of rum, and some glass bottles some of the common\\nsize, and others which were case bottles, square, for the holding of\\nwater, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except\\na great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big\\nfor such as I desired it viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by\\nitself. The second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but\\nit was impossible to me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for\\nthat, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my second rows of\\nstakes or piles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry\\nseason, when another business took me up more time than it could be\\nimagined I could spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. SURVEYS HIS POSITION\\n\\n\\nI mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and\\nthat I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,\\nand where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the\\nisland. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that\\nside; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity\\nof powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch\\nof raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey. When I had\\npassed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of\\nthe sea to the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried\\nland whether an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very\\nhigh, extending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by\\nmy guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\\n\\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than\\nthat I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my\\nobservations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all\\ninhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been in a worse\\ncondition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the\\ndispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe\\nordered everything for the best; I say I quieted my mind with this, and\\nleft off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.\\n\\nBesides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if this\\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was\\nthe savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are\\nfound the worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and\\nfail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their\\nhands.\\n\\nWith these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I found\\nthat side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine the\\nopen or savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full\\nof very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have\\ncaught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to\\nspeak to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I\\nknocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it\\nhome; but it was some years before I could make him speak; however, at\\nlast I taught him to call me by name very familiarly. But the accident\\nthat followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its\\nplace.\\n\\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low\\ngrounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed\\ngreatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy\\nmyself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be\\nventurous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good\\ntoo, especially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or\\ntortoise, which added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have\\nfurnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and\\nthough my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for\\nthankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had\\nrather plenty, even to dainties.\\n\\nI never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or\\nthereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see what\\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I\\nresolved to sit down all night; and then I either reposed myself in a\\ntree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the\\nground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature\\ncould come at me without waking me.\\n\\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had\\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the\\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I\\nhad found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite\\nnumber of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I\\nhad not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I\\nknew not the names of, except those called penguins.\\n\\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my\\npowder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat if I\\ncould, which I could better feed on; and though there were many goats\\nhere, more than on my side the island, yet it was with much more\\ndifficulty that I could come near them, the country being flat and\\neven, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.\\n\\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but\\nyet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my\\nhabitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was\\nhere to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I\\ntravelled along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about\\ntwelve miles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a\\nmark, I concluded I would go home again, and that the next journey I\\ntook should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling,\\nand so round till I came to my post again.\\n\\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could\\neasily keep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss\\nfinding my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself\\nmistaken, for being come about two or three miles, I found myself\\ndescended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and\\nthose hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my way by\\nany direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very\\nwell the position of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to\\nmy further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four\\ndays while I was in the valley, and not being able to see the sun, I\\nwandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find the\\nseaside, look for my post, and come back the same way I went: and then,\\nby easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot,\\nand my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.\\n\\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and\\nI, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from\\nthe dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had\\noften been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two,\\nand so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my\\npowder and shot should be all spent. I made a collar for this little\\ncreature, and with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which I\\nalways carried about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty,\\ntill I came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I\\nwas very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above a\\nmonth.\\n\\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey,\\nwithout settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my\\nown house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me\\ncompared to that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable,\\nthat I resolved I would never go a great way from it again while it\\nshould be my lot to stay on the island.\\n\\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\\njourney; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty\\naffair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere\\ndomestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of\\nthe poor kid which I had penned in within my little circle, and\\nresolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I\\nwent, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,\\nbut was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of\\ntrees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over,\\nand having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it\\nwas so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for\\nit followed me like a dog: and as I continually fed it, the creature\\nbecame so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time\\none of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.\\n\\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the\\n30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the\\nanniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there two\\nyears, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I\\ncame there, I spent the whole day in humble and thankful\\nacknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary\\ncondition was attended with, and without which it might have been\\ninfinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God had\\nbeen pleased to discover to me that it was possible I might be more\\nhappy in this solitary condition than I should have been in the liberty\\nof society, and in all the pleasures of the world; that He could fully\\nmake up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of\\nhuman society, by His presence and the communications of His grace to\\nmy soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon His\\nprovidence here, and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.\\n\\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life\\nI now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,\\ncursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days; and now I\\nchanged both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my\\naffections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from\\nwhat they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.\\n\\nBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing the\\ncountry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me\\non a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the\\nwoods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner,\\nlocked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an\\nuninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the\\ngreatest composure of my mind, this would break out upon me like a\\nstorm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a child. Sometimes it\\nwould take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit\\ndown and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two together;\\nand this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or\\nvent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted\\nitself, would abate.\\n\\nBut now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the\\nword of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.\\nOne morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words,  I\\nwill never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  Immediately it\\noccurred that these words were to me; why else should they be directed\\nin such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my\\ncondition, as one forsaken of God and man?  Well, then,  said I,  if\\nGod does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what\\nmatters it, though the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other\\nhand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and blessing\\nof God, there would be no comparison in the loss? \\n\\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible\\nfor me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it\\nwas probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in\\nthe world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for\\nbringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but something\\nshocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.  How\\ncanst thou become such a hypocrite,  said I, even audibly,  to pretend\\nto be thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to\\nbe contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered\\nfrom?  So I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God for\\nbeing there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by\\nwhatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my\\nlife, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the\\nBible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing\\nmy friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my\\ngoods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of\\nthe ship.\\n\\nThus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and\\nthough I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an\\naccount of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be\\nobserved that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my\\ntime according to the several daily employments that were before me,\\nsuch as: first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I\\nconstantly set apart some time for thrice every day; secondly, the\\ngoing abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three\\nhours in every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering,\\ncutting, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught for my\\nsupply; these took up great part of the day. Also, it is to be\\nconsidered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the\\nzenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that\\nabout four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to\\nwork in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of\\nhunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with\\nmy gun in the afternoon.\\n\\nTo this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the\\nexceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of\\ntools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of\\nmy time. For example, I was full two and forty days in making a board\\nfor a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with\\ntheir tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same\\ntree in half a day.\\n\\nMy case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down,\\nbecause my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days in\\ncutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a\\nlog or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduced\\nboth the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to\\nmove; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a\\nboard from end to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other\\nside til I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth\\non both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece\\nof work; but labour and patience carried me through that, and many\\nother things. I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why\\nso much of my time went away with so little work viz. that what might\\nbe a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and\\nrequired a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But\\nnotwithstanding this, with patience and labour I got through everything\\nthat my circumstances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by\\nwhat follows.\\n\\nI was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\\nbarley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not\\ngreat; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity\\nof half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry\\nseason. But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I\\nwas in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which\\nit was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and\\nwild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the\\nblade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so\\nclose, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.\\n\\nThis I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a\\nhedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it\\nrequired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my\\ncrop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks  time; and\\nshooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it\\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen\\napace.\\n\\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so\\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for,\\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\\nsurrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it\\nwere, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them,\\nfor I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose\\nup a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the\\ncorn itself.\\n\\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would\\ndevour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be able to\\nraise a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell; however, I\\nresolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it\\nnight and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what damage\\nwas already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but\\nthat as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great but\\nthat the remainder was likely to be a good crop if it could be saved.\\n\\nI stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see\\nthe thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited\\ntill I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked\\noff, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they\\ndropped down one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I\\ncould not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every\\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in\\nthe consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed\\nthree of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and\\nserved them as we serve notorious thieves in England hanged them in\\nchains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that this\\nshould have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not\\ncome at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the\\nisland, and I could never see a bird near the place as long as my\\nscarecrows hung there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and\\nabout the latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the\\nyear, I reaped my corn.\\n\\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I\\ncould do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the\\nbroadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the\\nship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great\\ndifficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut\\nnothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I\\nhad made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my\\nharvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed I had near two\\nbushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley; that is to\\nsay, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time.\\n\\nHowever, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in\\ntime, it would please God to supply me with bread. And yet here I was\\nperplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my\\ncorn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal,\\nhow to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to\\nbake it. These things being added to my desire of having a good\\nquantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to\\ntaste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next\\nseason; and in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working\\nto accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.\\n\\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I believe few\\npeople have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things\\nnecessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and\\nfinishing this one article of bread.\\n\\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily\\ndiscouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after\\nI had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came\\nup unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.\\n\\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth no spade or shovel to dig\\nit. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed\\nbefore; but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost\\nme a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only\\nwore out soon, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed\\nmuch worse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out\\nwith patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the\\ncorn was sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself,\\nand drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it\\nmay be called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was growing, and\\ngrown, I have observed already how many things I wanted to fence it,\\nsecure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from\\nthe chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to\\ndress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it;\\nbut all these things I did without, as shall be observed; and yet the\\ncorn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I\\nsaid, made everything laborious and tedious to me; but that there was\\nno help for. Neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I had\\ndivided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to these\\nworks; and as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I\\nhad a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself\\nwholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper\\nfor the performing all the operations necessary for making the corn,\\nwhen I had it, fit for my use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. A BOAT\\n\\n\\nBut first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow\\nabove an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week s work at\\nleast to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one\\nindeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to work with it.\\nHowever, I got through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces\\nof ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced\\nthem in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that\\nwood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in a\\nyear s time, I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would\\nwant but little repair. This work did not take me up less than three\\nmonths, because a great part of that time was the wet season, when I\\ncould not go abroad. Within-doors, that is when it rained and I could\\nnot go out, I found employment in the following occupations always\\nobserving, that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with\\ntalking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught\\nhim to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud,\\n Poll,  which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by\\nany mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an\\nassistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment\\nupon my hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some means or\\nother, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew\\nnot where to come at them. However, considering the heat of the\\nclimate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make\\nsome pots that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong\\nenough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and\\nrequired to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the preparing\\ncorn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make\\nsome as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what\\nshould be put into them.\\n\\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how\\nmany awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly\\nthings I made; how many of them fell in and how many fell out, the clay\\nnot being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the\\nover-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many\\nfell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were\\ndried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the\\nclay to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it I could not\\nmake above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in\\nabout two months  labour.\\n\\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them\\nvery gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets,\\nwhich I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as\\nbetween the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I\\nstuffed it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being\\nto stand always dry I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the\\nmeal, when the corn was bruised.\\n\\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made\\nseveral smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,\\nflat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to;\\nand the heat of the sun baked them quite hard.\\n\\nBut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot\\nto hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could\\ndo. It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking\\nmy meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a\\nbroken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as\\nhard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see\\nit, and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn\\nwhole, if they would burn broken.\\n\\nThis set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some\\npots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of\\nglazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I\\nplaced three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon\\nanother, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of\\nembers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside\\nand upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite\\nthrough, and observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw them\\nclear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till\\nI found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the\\nsand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,\\nand would have run into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire\\ngradually till the pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching\\nthem all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the\\nmorning I had three very good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and\\ntwo other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of\\nthem perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.\\n\\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of\\nearthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of them,\\nthey were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way\\nof making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would\\nmake pies that never learned to raise paste.\\n\\nNo joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I\\nfound I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had\\nhardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set one on the\\nfire again with some water in it to boil me some meat, which it did\\nadmirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,\\nthough I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to\\nmake it as good as I would have had it been.\\n\\nMy next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn\\nin; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that\\nperfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was at\\na great loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly\\nunqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any\\ntools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone\\nbig enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find\\nnone at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way\\nto dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness\\nsufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither\\nwould bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn\\nwithout filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in\\nsearching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a\\ngreat block of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and\\ngetting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed\\nit on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of\\nfire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in\\nBrazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or\\nbeater of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid\\nby against I had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to\\ngrind, or rather pound into meal to make bread.\\n\\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my meal, and\\nto part it from the bran and the husk; without which I did not see it\\npossible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing even\\nto think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to\\nmake it I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through.\\nAnd here I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know\\nwhat to do. Linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat s\\nhair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how,\\nhere were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for\\nthis was, that at last I did remember I had, among the seamen s clothes\\nwhich were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;\\nand with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough\\nfor the work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did\\nafterwards, I shall show in its place.\\n\\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\\nmake bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no yeast. As to\\nthat part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself\\nmuch about it. But for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At length I\\nfound out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some\\nearthen-vessels very broad but not deep, that is to say, about two feet\\ndiameter, and not above nine inches deep. These I burned in the fire,\\nas I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I\\nmade a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square\\ntiles of my own baking and burning also; but I should not call them\\nsquare.\\n\\nWhen the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals, I\\ndrew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and\\nthere I let them lie till the hearth was very hot. Then sweeping away\\nall the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the\\nearthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the\\npot, to keep in and add to the heat; and thus as well as in the best\\noven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became in little time\\na good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and\\npuddings of the rice; but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put\\ninto them supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.\\n\\nIt need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of\\nthe third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed that in the\\nintervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;\\nfor I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I\\ncould, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time\\nto rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to\\nthrash it with.\\n\\nAnd now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build\\nmy barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of\\nthe corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\\nbushels, and of the rice as much or more; insomuch that now I resolved\\nto begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great\\nwhile; also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me\\na whole year, and to sow but once a year.\\n\\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were\\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.\\n\\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other\\nside of the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on\\nshore there, fancying that, seeing the mainland, and an inhabited\\ncountry, I might find some way or other to convey myself further, and\\nperhaps at last find some means of escape.\\n\\nBut all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an\\nundertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and\\nperhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions\\nand tigers of Africa: that if I once came in their power, I should run\\na hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of\\nbeing eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast\\nwere cannibals or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could\\nnot be far from that shore. Then, supposing they were not cannibals,\\nyet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their\\nhands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty\\ntogether much more I, that was but one, and could make little or no\\ndefence; all these things, I say, which I ought to have considered\\nwell; and did come into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave me no\\napprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the thought of\\ngetting over to the shore.\\n\\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton\\nsail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of\\nAfrica; but this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our\\nship s boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great\\nway, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where\\nshe did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the\\nwaves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of\\nbeachy, rough sand, but no water about her. If I had had hands to have\\nrefitted her, and to have launched her into the water, the boat would\\nhave done well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with\\nher easily enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn\\nher and set her upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island;\\nhowever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought\\nthem to the boat resolving to try what I could do; suggesting to myself\\nthat if I could but turn her down, I might repair the damage she had\\nreceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in\\nher very easily.\\n\\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,\\nI think, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to\\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,\\nto undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to\\nthrust and guide it right in the fall.\\n\\nBut when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get\\nunder it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was\\nforced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the\\nboat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than\\ndecreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.\\n\\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make\\nmyself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates\\nmake, even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the\\ntrunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and\\npleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my\\nhaving much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians;\\nbut not at all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay\\nunder more than the Indians did viz. want of hands to move it, when it\\nwas made, into the water a difficulty much harder for me to surmount\\nthan all the consequences of want of tools could be to them; for what\\nwas it to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with\\nmuch trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew and\\ndub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out\\nthe inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it if, after all\\nthis, I must leave it just there where I found it, and not be able to\\nlaunch it into the water?\\n\\nOne would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon\\nmy mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should\\nhave immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my\\nthoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never\\nonce considered how I should get it off the land: and it was really, in\\nits own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of\\nsea than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it\\nafloat in the water.\\n\\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did\\nwho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,\\nwithout determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but\\nthat the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I\\nput a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave\\nmyself Let me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other\\nto get it along when it is done. \\n\\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\\nprevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and I question\\nmuch whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\\nof Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part\\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of\\ntwenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted\\ninto branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this\\ntree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was\\nfourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading\\nhead cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet,\\nand inexpressible labour; after this, it cost me a month to shape it\\nand dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,\\nthat it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three\\nmonths more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact\\nboat of it; this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and\\nchisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a\\nvery handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty\\nmen, and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.\\n\\nWhen I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with it.\\nThe boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua,\\nthat was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost,\\nyou may be sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no\\nquestion, but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most\\nunlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.\\n\\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost\\nme infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,\\nand not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards\\nthe creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig\\ninto the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began,\\nand it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains who\\nhave their deliverance in view?); but when this was worked through, and\\nthis difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no\\nmore stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the\\ndistance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the\\nwater up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the\\nwater. Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and\\ncalculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be\\nthrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but\\nmy own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone\\nthrough with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it\\nmust have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with\\ngreat reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.\\n\\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly\\nof our own strength to go through with it.\\n\\nIn the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and\\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\\never before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the\\nWord of God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different\\nknowledge from what I had before. I entertained different notions of\\nthings. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had\\nnothing to do with, no expectations from, and, indeed, no desires\\nabout: in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever\\nlikely to have, so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it\\nhereafter viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and\\nwell might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives,  Between me and thee is a\\ngreat gulf fixed. \\n\\nIn the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world\\nhere; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor\\nthe pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now\\ncapable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I\\nmight call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had\\npossession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to\\ndispute sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised\\nship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow\\nas I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough,\\nbut now and then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had\\ntimber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough\\nto have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that\\nfleet when it had been built.\\n\\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to\\neat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed\\nmore flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed\\nmore corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut\\ndown were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them\\nbut for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.\\n\\nIn a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon\\njust reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther\\ngood to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up\\nto give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The\\nmost covetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the\\nvice of covetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed\\ninfinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,\\nexcept it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles,\\nthough, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel\\nof money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.\\nAlas! there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no more manner of\\nbusiness for it; and often thought with myself that I would have given\\na handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to\\ngrind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for a sixpenny-worth of\\nturnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and\\nbeans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by\\nit or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy\\nwith the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the\\ndrawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case they had been of no\\nmanner of value to me, because of no use.\\n\\nI had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it\\nwas at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I\\nfrequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of\\nGod s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I\\nlearned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less\\nupon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I\\nwanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot\\nexpress them; and which I take notice of here, to put those\\ndiscontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what\\nGod has given them, because they see and covet something that He has\\nnot given them. All our discontents about what we want appeared to me\\nto spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.\\n\\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,\\nto compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would\\nbe; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence\\nof God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the\\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got\\nout of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I\\nhad wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and\\nshot for getting my food.\\n\\nI spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,\\nin the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing\\nout of the ship. How I could not have so much as got any food, except\\nfish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them,\\nI must have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not\\nperished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by\\nany contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh\\nfrom the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my\\nteeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.\\n\\nThese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence\\nto me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its\\nhardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend to\\nthe reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say,  Is any\\naffliction like mine?  Let them consider how much worse the cases of\\nsome people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had\\nthought fit.\\n\\nI had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind\\nwith hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had\\ndeserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of\\nProvidence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the\\nknowledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed by father and\\nmother; neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours\\nto infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and\\nwhat the nature and end of my being required of me. But, alas! falling\\nearly into the seafaring life, which of all lives is the most destitute\\nof the fear of God, though His terrors are always before them; I say,\\nfalling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all\\nthat little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out\\nof me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the\\nviews of death, which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all\\nmanner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was like\\nmyself, or to hear anything that was good or tended towards it.\\n\\nSo void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of what I\\nwas, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed such as\\nmy escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of\\nthe ship; my being planted so well in the Brazils; my receiving the\\ncargo from England, and the like I never had once the words  Thank\\nGod!  so much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest\\ndistress had I so much as a thought to pray to Him, or so much as to\\nsay,  Lord, have mercy upon me!  no, nor to mention the name of God,\\nunless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.\\n\\nI had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have\\nalready observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and\\nwhen I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had\\nattended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt\\nbountifully with me had not only punished me less than my iniquity had\\ndeserved, but had so plentifully provided for me this gave me great\\nhopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in\\nstore for me.\\n\\nWith these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation\\nto the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but\\neven to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was\\nyet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due\\npunishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no\\nreason to have expected in that place; that I ought never more to\\nrepine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for\\nthat daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have\\nbrought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle,\\neven as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long\\nseries of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a place in the\\nuninhabitable part of the world where I could have been cast more to my\\nadvantage; a place where, as I had no society, which was my affliction\\non one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or\\ntigers, to threaten my life; no venomous creatures, or poisons, which I\\nmight feed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me. In a\\nword, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of\\nmercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to\\nbe able to make my sense of God s goodness to me, and care over me in\\nthis condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a just\\nimprovement on these things, I went away, and was no more sad. I had\\nnow been here so long that many things which I had brought on shore for\\nmy help were either quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent.\\n\\nMy ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,\\nwhich I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so\\npale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as\\nit lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on\\nwhich any remarkable thing happened to me; and first, by casting up\\ntimes past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days\\nin the various providences which befell me, and which, if I had been\\nsuperstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might\\nhave had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.\\n\\nFirst, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from my\\nfather and friends and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the\\nsame day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a\\nslave; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that\\nship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape\\nfrom Sallee in a boat; the same day of the year I was born on viz. the\\n30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved\\ntwenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island; so\\nthat my wicked life and my solitary life began both on a day.\\n\\nThe next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread I mean the\\nbiscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the\\nlast degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a-day for above a\\nyear; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got\\nany corn of my own, and great reason I had to be thankful that I had\\nany at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to\\nmiraculous.\\n\\nMy clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a good\\nwhile, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the\\nother seamen, and which I carefully preserved; because many times I\\ncould bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great\\nhelp to me that I had, among all the men s clothes of the ship, almost\\nthree dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick\\nwatch-coats of the seamen s which were left, but they were too hot to\\nwear; and though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that\\nthere was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked no, though\\nI had been inclined to it, which I was not nor could I abide the\\nthought of it, though I was alone. The reason why I could not go naked\\nwas, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as\\nwith some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin:\\nwhereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and\\nwhistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more\\ncould I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a\\ncap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating with such violence as it\\ndoes in that place, would give me the headache presently, by darting so\\ndirectly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear\\nit; whereas, if I put on my hat it would presently go away.\\n\\nUpon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,\\nwhich I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the\\nwaistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make\\njackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such\\nother materials as I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or rather,\\nindeed, botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made\\nshift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me\\na great while: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry\\nshift indeed till afterwards.\\n\\nI have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I\\nkilled, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up, stretched out\\nwith sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and\\nhard that they were fit for little, but others were very useful. The\\nfirst thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair\\non the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well,\\nthat after I made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins that is to\\nsay, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for\\nthey were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must\\nnot omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a\\nbad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I made\\nvery good shift with, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the\\nhair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.\\n\\nAfter this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella;\\nI was, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one;\\nI had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the\\ngreat heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and\\ngreater too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be\\nmuch abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as\\nthe heats. I took a world of pains with it, and was a great while\\nbefore I could make anything likely to hold: nay, after I had thought I\\nhad hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind:\\nbut at last I made one that answered indifferently well: the main\\ndifficulty I found was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but\\nif it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any\\nway but just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I\\nsaid, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair\\nupwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept off\\nthe sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the\\nweather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest, and\\nwhen I had no need of it could close it, and carry it under my arm.\\n\\nThus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by\\nresigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon\\nthe disposal of His providence. This made my life better than sociable,\\nfor when I began to regret the want of conversation I would ask myself,\\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I\\nmay say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than\\nthe utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. TAMES GOATS\\n\\n\\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\\nhappened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\\nand place, as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my\\nyearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of\\nboth which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one\\nyear s provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my\\ndaily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a\\ncanoe, which at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of\\nsix feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost\\nhalf a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it\\nwithout considering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should\\nbe able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water,\\nor bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was as a\\nmemorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next\\ntime, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place\\nwhere I could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I\\nhave said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last,\\nI never gave it over; and though I was near two years about it, yet I\\nnever grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at\\nlast.\\n\\nHowever, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was\\nnot at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the\\nfirst; I mean of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was\\nabove forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted\\nto put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had\\na boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I\\nhad been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already\\ndescribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little\\njourney made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I\\nhad a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.\\n\\nFor this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and\\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail\\ntoo out of some of the pieces of the ship s sails which lay in store,\\nand of which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail,\\nand tried the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made\\nlittle lockers or boxes at each end of my boat, to put provisions,\\nnecessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or\\nthe spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the\\ninside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang\\ndown over it to keep it dry.\\n\\nI fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast, to\\nstand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an\\nawning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the\\nsea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At last,\\nbeing eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved\\nupon my cruise; and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage,\\nputting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should call them) of\\nbarley-bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a good\\ndeal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for\\nkilling more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned\\nbefore, I had saved out of the seamen s chests; these I took, one to\\nlie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.\\n\\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign or my\\ncaptivity, which you please that I set out on this voyage, and I found\\nit much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not\\nvery large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great\\nledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above\\nwater, some under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a\\nleague more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to\\ndouble the point.\\n\\nWhen I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,\\nand come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out\\nto sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came\\nto an anchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a\\nbroken grappling which I got out of the ship.\\n\\nHaving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a\\nhill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent\\nof it, and resolved to venture.\\n\\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a\\nstrong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and\\neven came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it because\\nI saw there might be some danger that when I came into it I might be\\ncarried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the\\nisland again; and indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe\\nit would have been so; for there was the same current on the other side\\nthe island, only that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there\\nwas a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get\\nout of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.\\n\\nI lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at\\nESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach\\nof the sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for me to keep too\\nclose to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of\\nthe stream.\\n\\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the\\nsea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and\\nignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not\\neven my boat s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great\\ndepth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my\\nboat along with it with such violence that all I could do could not\\nkeep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me\\nfarther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. There\\nwas no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my paddles\\nsignified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost; for as\\nthe current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues\\ndistance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor\\ndid I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect\\nbefore me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough,\\nbut of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the\\nshore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat;\\nand I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen\\npots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,\\nto be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand\\nleagues at least?\\n\\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even\\nthe most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon\\nmy desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world\\nand all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there\\nagain. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes O happy\\ndesert!  said I,  I shall never see thee more. O miserable creature!\\nwhither am going?  Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper,\\nand that I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I\\ngive to be on shore there again! Thus, we never see the true state of\\nour condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know\\nhow to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarcely\\npossible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from\\nmy beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide\\nocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering\\nit again. However, I worked hard till, indeed, my strength was almost\\nexhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards\\nthe side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could;\\nwhen about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a\\nlittle breeze of wind in my face, springing up from SSE. This cheered\\nmy heart a little, and especially when, in about half-an-hour more, it\\nblew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I had got at a frightful\\ndistance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather\\nintervened, I had been undone another way, too; for I had no compass on\\nboard, and should never have known how to have steered towards the\\nisland, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather continuing\\nclear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail,\\nstanding away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the\\ncurrent.\\n\\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,\\nI saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current\\nwas near; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but\\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I\\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\\nrocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the\\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made\\na strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very\\nsharp stream.\\n\\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who\\nhave been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of\\njoy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and\\nthe wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running\\ncheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot.\\n\\nThis eddy carried me about a league on my way back again, directly\\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than\\nthe current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near\\nthe island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to\\nsay, the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out\\nfrom.\\n\\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this\\ncurrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further.\\nHowever, I found that being between two great currents viz. that on the\\nsouth side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay\\nabout a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake\\nof the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way;\\nand having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering\\ndirectly for the island, though not making such fresh way as I did\\nbefore.\\n\\nAbout four o clock in the evening, being then within a league of the\\nisland, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster\\nstretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting\\noff the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to\\nthe north; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the\\nway my course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However,\\nhaving a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west;\\nand in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it\\nbeing smooth water, I soon got to land.\\n\\nWhen I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks for my\\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by\\nmy boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my\\nboat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some\\ntrees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and\\nfatigue of the voyage.\\n\\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat! I had run\\nso much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting\\nit by the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean\\nthe west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures;\\nso I resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the\\nshore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate\\nin safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three\\nmiles or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet\\nor bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little\\nrivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat,\\nand where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose\\nfor her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on\\nshore to look about me, and see where I was.\\n\\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out\\nof my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began\\nmy march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had\\nbeen upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found\\neverything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,\\nbeing, as I said before, my country house.\\n\\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs,\\nfor I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that\\nread my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my\\nsleep by a voice calling me by my name several times,  Robin, Robin,\\nRobin Crusoe: poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are\\nyou? Where have you been? \\n\\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or part of\\nthe day, and with walking the latter part, that I did not wake\\nthoroughly; but dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but\\nas the voice continued to repeat,  Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,  at last\\nI began to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened,\\nand started up in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes\\nopen, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and\\nimmediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such\\nbemoaning language I had used to talk to him and teach him; and he had\\nlearned it so perfectly that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his\\nbill close to my face and cry,  Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where\\nhave you been? How came you here?  and such things as I had taught him.\\n\\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could\\nbe nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.\\nFirst, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he\\nshould just keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well\\nsatisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and\\nholding out my hand, and calling him by his name,  Poll,  the sociable\\ncreature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and\\ncontinued talking to me,  Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here?\\nand where had I been?  just as if he had been overjoyed to see me\\nagain; and so I carried him home along with me.\\n\\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough\\nto do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been\\nin. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of\\nthe island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As\\nto the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well\\nenough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and\\nmy very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side\\nof the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the\\ncurrent ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it\\npassed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being driven\\ndown the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of\\nbeing carried away from it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself\\nto be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many\\nmonths  labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.\\n\\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year; and lived a\\nvery sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts\\nbeing very much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in\\nresigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived\\nreally very happily in all things except that of society.\\n\\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should,\\nupon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering\\nhow few tools I had.\\n\\nBesides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,\\nand contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found\\ninfinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shaped,\\nwhich before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was\\nnever more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I\\nfound out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it\\nwas a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red,\\nlike other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the\\nsmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used\\nto smoke; and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first,\\nnot thinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I\\nsearched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes.\\n\\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome,\\nyet they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things\\nup in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad,\\nI could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces,\\nand bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it\\nup, take out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough\\nfor me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.\\nAlso, large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I always\\nrubbed out as soon as it was dry and cured, and kept it in great\\nbaskets.\\n\\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want\\nwhich it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\\nsay, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is observed in the third\\nyear of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I\\nwas in hopes of getting a he-goat; but I could not by any means bring\\nit to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in\\nmy heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.\\n\\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have\\nsaid, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap\\nand snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them\\nalive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young. For this\\npurpose I made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more\\nthan once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,\\nand I always found them broken and my bait devoured. At length I\\nresolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in\\nplaces where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits\\nI placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great weight upon them;\\nand several times I put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the\\ntrap; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten\\nup the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set\\nthree traps in one night, and going the next morning I found them, all\\nstanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.\\nHowever, I altered my traps; and not to trouble you with particulars,\\ngoing one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large old\\nhe-goat; and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.\\n\\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce I\\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away\\nalive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was\\nnot my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and\\nhe ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I did not\\nthen know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion. If I\\nhad let him stay three or four days without food, and then have carried\\nhim some water to drink and then a little corn, he would have been as\\ntame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable\\ncreatures, where they are well used.\\n\\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:\\nthen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\\n\\nIt was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some\\nsweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found\\nthat if I expected to supply myself with goats  flesh, when I had no\\npowder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when,\\nperhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But\\nthen it occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else\\nthey would always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this\\nwas to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with\\nhedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those within might\\nnot break out, or those without break in.\\n\\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw there\\nwas an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a\\nproper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them\\nto eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\\n\\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\\ncontrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these\\n(being a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people\\ncall it in the western colonies), which had two or three little drills\\nof fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody I say, they will\\nsmile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this\\npiece of ground in such a manner that, my hedge or pale must have been\\nat least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the\\ncompass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough\\nto do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in\\nso much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have\\nso much room to chase them in that I should never catch them.\\n\\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when\\nthis thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the\\nbeginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty\\nyards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would\\nmaintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my\\nstock increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.\\n\\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I\\nwas about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done\\nit, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to\\nfeed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I\\nwould go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and\\nfeed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished and I\\nlet them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for\\na handful of corn.\\n\\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of\\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had\\nthree-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food.\\nAfter that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,\\nwith little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted, and gates out\\nof one piece of ground into another.\\n\\nBut this was not all; for now I not only had goat s flesh to feed on\\nwhen I pleased, but milk too a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I\\ndid not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,\\nwas really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had\\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives\\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\\nbutter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays\\nand miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also salt\\n(though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon\\nsome of the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How\\nmercifully can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those\\nconditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How\\ncan He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise\\nHim for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here spread for me in\\nthe wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. FINDS PRINT OF MAN S FOOT ON THE SAND\\n\\n\\nIt would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family\\nsit down to dinner. There was my majesty the prince and lord of the\\nwhole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute\\ncommand; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no\\nrebels among all my subjects. Then, to see how like a king I dined,\\ntoo, all alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my\\nfavourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was\\nnow grown old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind\\nupon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the\\ntable and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,\\nas a mark of especial favour.\\n\\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for\\nthey were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation\\nby my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what\\nkind of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas\\nthe rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at\\nlast, for they would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till\\nat last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at\\nlength they left me. With this attendance and in this plentiful manner\\nI lived; neither could I be said to want anything but society; and of\\nthat, some time after this, I was likely to have too much.\\n\\nI was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my\\nboat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore\\nsometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at\\nother times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I had a\\nstrange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island\\nwhere, as I have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how\\nthe shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to\\ndo: this inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I\\nresolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I\\ndid so; but had any one in England met such a man as I was, it must\\neither have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as\\nI frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at\\nthe notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,\\nand in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as\\nfollows.\\n\\nI had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat s skin, with a flap\\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the\\nrain off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these\\nclimates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.\\n\\nI had a short jacket of goat s skin, the skirts coming down to about\\nthe middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the\\nsame; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair\\nhung down such a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it\\nreached to the middle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but\\nhad made me a pair of somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, like\\nbuskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like\\nspatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the\\nrest of my clothes.\\n\\nI had on a broad belt of goat s skin dried, which I drew together with\\ntwo thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on\\neither side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw\\nand a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other. I had another belt\\nnot so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my\\nshoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,\\nboth made of goat s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the\\nother my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my\\ngun, and over my head a great clumsy, ugly, goat s-skin umbrella, but\\nwhich, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me next to\\nmy gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like\\nas one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living\\nwithin nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered\\nto grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both\\nscissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what\\ngrew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of\\nMahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee,\\nfor the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these\\nmoustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang\\nmy hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough,\\nand such as in England would have passed for frightful.\\n\\nBut all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to\\nobserve me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of\\nthat. In this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or\\nsix days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place\\nwhere I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and\\nhaving no boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way\\nto the same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the\\npoints of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double\\nwith my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all\\nsmooth and quiet no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there\\nthan in other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and\\nresolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from\\nthe sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced\\nhow it was viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining\\nwith the current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be\\nthe occasion of this current, and that, according as the wind blew more\\nforcibly from the west or from the north, this current came nearer or\\nwent farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I\\nwent up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I\\nplainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther off,\\nbeing near half a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set\\nclose upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which\\nat another time it would not have done.\\n\\nThis observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe\\nthe ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring\\nmy boat about the island again; but when I began to think of putting it\\nin practice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of\\nthe danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any\\npatience, but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was\\nmore safe, though more laborious and this was, that I would build, or\\nrather make, me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side\\nof the island, and one for the other.\\n\\nYou are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\\nin the island one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about\\nit, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had\\nenlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. One of\\nthese, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my\\nwall or fortification that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to\\nthe rock was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have\\ngiven an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which\\nwould hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of\\nprovisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the\\nstraw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.\\n\\nAs for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one s view,\\nof any habitation behind them.\\n\\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly\\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\\nseason; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\\nadjoining as fit as that.\\n\\nBesides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable\\nplantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called\\nit, which I kept in repair that is to say, I kept the hedge which\\nencircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder\\nstanding always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no\\nmore than stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so\\nthat they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more\\nagreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle\\nof this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread\\nover poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair\\nor renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch with the\\nskins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a\\nblanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had\\nsaved; and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had\\noccasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country\\nhabitation.\\n\\nAdjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say my\\ngoats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\\nenclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the\\ngoats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite\\nlabour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,\\nand so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and\\nthere was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which\\nafterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy\\nseason, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any\\nwall.\\n\\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no\\npains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable\\nsupport, for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus\\nat my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and\\ncheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty\\nyears; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my\\nperfecting my enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of\\nkeeping them together; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually\\nsecured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted\\nthem so very thick that I was forced to pull some of them up again.\\n\\nIn this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally\\ndepended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to\\npreserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my\\nwhole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal,\\nwholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\\n\\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the\\nplace where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in\\nmy way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all\\nthings about or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes I went\\nout in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,\\nscarcely ever above a stone s cast or two from the shore, I was so\\napprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents\\nor winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my\\nlife.\\n\\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was\\nexceedingly surprised with the print of a man s naked foot on the\\nshore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one\\nthunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked\\nround me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a\\nrising ground to look farther; I went up the shore and down the shore,\\nbut it was all one; I could see no other impression but that one. I\\nwent to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it\\nmight not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was\\nexactly the print of a foot toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How\\nit came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but after\\ninnumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out\\nof myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the\\nground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me\\nat every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and\\nfancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to\\ndescribe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented\\nthings to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my\\nfancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts\\nby the way.\\n\\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this),\\nI fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as\\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called\\na door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning,\\nfor never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more\\nterror of mind than I to this retreat.\\n\\nI slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my\\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary\\nto the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of\\nall creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful\\nideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to\\nmyself, even though I was now a great way off. Sometimes I fancied it\\nmust be the devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition,\\nfor how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?\\nWhere was the vessel that brought them? What marks were there of any\\nother footstep? And how was it possible a man should come there? But\\nthen, to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a\\nplace, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave\\nthe print of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for\\nhe could not be sure I should see it this was an amusement the other\\nway. I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of\\nother ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a\\nfoot; that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would\\nnever have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was\\nten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the\\nsand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would\\nhave defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing\\nitself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of\\nthe devil.\\n\\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\\napprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then\\nthat it must be some more dangerous creature viz. that it must be some\\nof the savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in\\ntheir canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds,\\nhad made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to\\nsea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as\\nI would have been to have had them.\\n\\nWhile these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in\\nmy thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,\\nor that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded\\nthat some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched\\nfarther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about\\ntheir having found out my boat, and that there were people here; and\\nthat, if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers\\nand devour me; that if it should happen that they should not find me,\\nyet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away\\nall my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\\n\\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence\\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had\\nof His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not\\npreserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His\\ngoodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any\\nmore corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if\\nno accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was\\nupon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved\\nfor the future to have two or three years  corn beforehand; so that,\\nwhatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.\\n\\nHow strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by\\nwhat secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as\\ndifferent circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate;\\nto-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow\\nwe fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was\\nexemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable;\\nfor I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from human\\nsociety, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut\\noff from mankind, and condemned to what I call silent life; that I was\\nas one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living,\\nor to appear among the rest of His creatures; that to have seen one of\\nmy own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life,\\nand the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme\\nblessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble\\nat the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into\\nthe ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set\\nhis foot in the island.\\n\\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\\nsurprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely\\nwise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could\\nnot foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I\\nwas not to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an\\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\\nHe thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had\\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought\\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because\\nI had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not\\nonly righteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and\\nafflict me, so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit\\nto do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and\\nentirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to\\nhope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and\\ndirections of His daily providence.\\n\\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and\\nmonths: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I\\ncannot omit. One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with\\nthoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it\\ndiscomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came\\ninto my thoughts,  Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will\\ndeliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.  Upon this, rising cheerfully\\nout of my bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and\\nencouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done\\npraying I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words\\nthat presented to me were,  Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and\\nHe shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.  It is\\nimpossible to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully\\nlaid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.\\n\\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\\ncame into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of\\nmy own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I\\ncame on shore from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I\\nbegan to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing\\nelse but my own foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat,\\nas well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also\\nthat I could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I\\nhad not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot,\\nI had played the part of those fools who try to make stories of\\nspectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than\\nanybody.\\n\\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\\nstarve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but\\nsome barley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be\\nmilked too, which usually was my evening diversion: and the poor\\ncreatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and,\\nindeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.\\nEncouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing\\nbut the print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to\\nstart at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my\\ncountry house to milk my flock: but to see with what fear I went\\nforward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now and\\nthen to lay down my basket and run for my life, it would have made any\\none have thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had\\nbeen lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I\\nwent down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I began to\\nbe a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it but my\\nown imagination; but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I\\nshould go down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and\\nmeasure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness,\\nthat I might be assured it was my own foot: but when I came to the\\nplace, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat\\nI could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when I\\ncame to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large\\nby a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new\\nimaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree, so\\nthat I shook with cold like one in an ague; and I went home again,\\nfilled with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there;\\nor, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised\\nbefore I was aware; and what course to take for my security I knew not.\\n\\nOh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It\\ndeprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their\\nrelief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my\\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the\\nenemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the\\nsame or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two\\ncorn-fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be\\nprompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent,\\nthat they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to\\nlook farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.\\n\\nThese were the subject of the first night s cogitations after I was\\ncome home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind\\nwere fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours. Thus, fear of\\ndanger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when\\napparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by\\nmuch, than the evil which we are anxious about: and what was worse than\\nall this, I had not that relief in this trouble that from the\\nresignation I used to practise I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,\\nlike Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were upon him,\\nbut that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to\\ncompose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon His\\nprovidence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance;\\nwhich, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported\\nunder this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more\\nresolution.\\n\\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the\\nmorning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as\\nit were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and\\nwaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began\\nto think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this\\nisland (which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther\\nfrom the mainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as\\nI might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who\\nlived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from\\nthe shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they were\\ndriven by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had lived there\\nfifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of\\nany people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it\\nwas probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing\\nthey had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most\\nI could suggest any danger from was from any casual accidental landing\\nof straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were\\ndriven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay\\nhere, but went off again with all possible speed; seldom staying one\\nnight on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and\\ndaylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to\\nconsider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land\\nupon the spot.\\n\\nNow, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to\\nbring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond\\nwhere my fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering\\nthis, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the\\nmanner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had\\nplanted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I\\nmade mention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they\\nwanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they might be\\nthicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. So that I had\\nnow a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of\\ntimber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong;\\nhaving in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out\\nat. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick\\nwith continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the\\nfoot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I\\ncontrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got\\nseven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon, and\\nfitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I\\ncould fire all the seven guns in two minutes  time; this wall I was\\nmany a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till\\nit was done.\\n\\nWhen this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\\nlength every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,\\nwhich I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I\\nbelieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty\\nlarge space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an\\nenemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they\\nattempted to approach my outer wall.\\n\\nThus in two years  time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years \\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and\\nstrong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what\\nkind soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much\\nless a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in\\nand out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a\\npart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to\\nplace another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down\\nno man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and\\nif they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\\n\\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\\npreservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not\\naltogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time\\nmore than my mere fear suggested to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. A CAVE RETREAT\\n\\n\\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other\\naffairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats:\\nthey were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to\\nbe sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also\\nwithout the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to\\nlose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over\\nagain.\\n\\nFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two\\nways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig\\na cave underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the\\nother was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one\\nanother, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about\\nhalf-a-dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster\\nhappened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again\\nwith little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good\\ndeal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.\\n\\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of\\nthe island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my\\nheart could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of\\nthe hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself\\nonce before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part\\nof the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so\\nsurrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at\\nleast, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other\\npiece of ground I had worked so hard at.\\n\\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than\\na month s time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it\\nwhich you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be\\nsupposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further\\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece,\\nand when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had\\nmade it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure,\\nand it took me up more time by a great deal. All this labour I was at\\nthe expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of\\na man s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near\\nthe island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,\\nindeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may\\nbe well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant\\nsnare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too,\\nthat the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the\\nreligious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into\\nthe hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I\\nseldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker; at\\nleast, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was\\nwont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and\\npressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every\\nnight of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must\\ntestify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,\\nlove, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that\\nof terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief\\nimpending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the\\nduty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for\\nthese discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and the\\ndiscomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as\\nthat of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an\\nact of the mind, not of the body.\\n\\nBut to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little living\\nstock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private\\nplace to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west\\npoint of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I\\nthought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a\\nperspective glass or two in one of the seamen s chests, which I saved\\nout of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that\\nI could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes\\nwere not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was a boat or not\\nI do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of\\nit, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a\\nperspective glass in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the\\nend of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was\\npresently convinced that the seeing the print of a man s foot was not\\nsuch a strange thing in the island as I imagined: and but that it was a\\nspecial providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where\\nthe savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was\\nmore frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to\\nbe a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the\\nisland for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their\\ncanoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over\\nto this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all\\ncannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.\\n\\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the\\nSW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is\\nit possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore\\nspread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and\\nparticularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a\\ncircle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage\\nwretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their\\nfellow-creatures.\\n\\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained\\nno notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my\\napprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,\\nhellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,\\nwhich, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view\\nof before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle;\\nmy stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when\\nnature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with\\nuncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay\\nin the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I\\ncould, and walked on towards my own habitation.\\n\\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still\\nawhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the\\nutmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes,\\ngave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world\\nwhere I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and\\nthat, though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had\\nyet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give\\nthanks for than to complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even\\nin this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of\\nHimself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a felicity more than\\nsufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or\\ncould suffer.\\n\\nIn this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be\\nmuch easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was\\nbefore: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in\\nsearch of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not\\nexpecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the\\ncovered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose. I\\nknew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least\\nfootsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years\\nmore as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself\\nto them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only\\nbusiness to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found\\na better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet\\nI entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have\\nbeen speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their\\ndevouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,\\nand kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this:\\nwhen I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations viz. my\\ncastle, my country seat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in\\nthe woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than an\\nenclosure for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these\\nhellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of\\nseeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat\\nall this time, but began rather to think of making another; for I could\\nnot think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat\\nround the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures\\nat sea; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their\\nhands, I knew what would have been my lot.\\n\\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of\\nbeing discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about\\nthem; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before,\\nonly with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes\\nmore about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any\\nof them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest\\nany of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it. It was,\\ntherefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself\\nwith a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more\\nabout the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after\\nthis, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two\\nyears after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I\\nnever went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three\\npistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least\\ntwo of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I also furbished up\\none of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a\\nbelt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to\\nlook at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of\\nmyself the particular of two pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my\\nside in a belt, but without a scabbard.\\n\\nThings going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,\\nexcepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way\\nof living. All these things tended to show me more and more how far my\\ncondition was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to\\nmany other particulars of life which it might have pleased God to have\\nmade my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would\\nbe among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather\\ncompare their condition with those that were worse, in order to be\\nthankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to\\nassist their murmurings and complainings.\\n\\nAs in my present condition there were not really many things which I\\nwanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these\\nsavage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,\\nhad taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences; and I\\nhad dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and\\nthat was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and\\nthen try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought,\\nand I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently\\nsaw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making\\nmy beer that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks\\nto preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,\\nI could never compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but\\nweeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next\\nplace, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no\\ncopper or kettle to make it boil; and yet with all these things\\nwanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in\\nabout the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought\\nit to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing\\nit, when once I had it in my head to began it. But my invention now ran\\nquite another way; for night and day I could think of nothing but how I\\nmight destroy some of the monsters in their cruel, bloody\\nentertainment, and if possible save the victim they should bring hither\\nto destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is\\nintended to be to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather\\nbrooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at\\nleast frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more:\\nbut all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect,\\nunless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one man do\\namong them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them\\ntogether with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they\\ncould shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?\\n\\nSometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made\\ntheir fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when\\nthey kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all\\nthat was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to\\nwaste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity\\nof one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any\\ncertain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would\\ndo little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright\\nthem, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it\\naside; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some\\nconvenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the\\nmiddle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure\\nto kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling\\nin upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but\\nthat, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy pleased\\nmy thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often\\ndreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them\\nin my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination that I employed\\nmyself several days to find out proper places to put myself in\\nambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went frequently to the\\nplace itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while my\\nmind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting\\ntwenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I\\nhad at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches\\ndevouring one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length I found a\\nplace in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might securely\\nwait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even before\\nthey would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some\\nthickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to\\nconceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their bloody\\ndoings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close\\ntogether as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my\\nshot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first\\nshot. In this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and\\naccordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The\\ntwo muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five\\nsmaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the\\nfowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest\\nsize; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and, in\\nthis posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third\\ncharge, I prepared myself for my expedition.\\n\\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination\\nput it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top\\nof the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three\\nmiles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming\\nnear the island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of\\nthis hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my\\nwatch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in\\nall that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the\\nshore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach\\nevery way.\\n\\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also\\nI kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the\\nwhile in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing\\ntwenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all\\nentered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my\\npassions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural\\ncustom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered\\nby Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other\\nguide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and\\nconsequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act\\nsuch horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but\\nnature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish\\ndegeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I\\nbegan to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long\\nand so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself\\nbegan to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to\\nconsider what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to\\npretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom\\nHeaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on,\\nand to be as it were the executioners of His judgments one upon\\nanother; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right\\nI had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed\\npromiscuously upon one another. I debated this very often with myself\\nthus:  How do I know what God Himself judges in this particular case?\\nIt is certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not\\nagainst their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching\\nthem; they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in\\ndefiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.\\nThey think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do\\nto kill an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton. \\n\\nWhen I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was\\ncertainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the\\nsense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than\\nthose Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners\\ntaken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole\\ntroops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw\\ndown their arms and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me\\nthat although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and\\ninhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no\\ninjury: that if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate\\npreservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it: but\\nthat I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of\\nme, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be\\njust for me to fall upon them; that this would justify the conduct of\\nthe Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in America, where they\\ndestroyed millions of these people; who, however they were idolators\\nand barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their\\ncustoms, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as\\nto the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out\\nof the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation\\nby even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other\\nChristian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural\\npiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and for which the\\nvery name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible, to\\nall people of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of\\nSpain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who\\nwere without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to\\nthe miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the\\nmind.\\n\\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\\nstop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to\\nconclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the\\nsavages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless\\nthey first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to\\nprevent: but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my\\nduty. On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the\\nway not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for\\nunless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at\\nthat time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of\\nthem escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they would\\ncome over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and\\nI should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at\\npresent, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded\\nthat I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to\\nconcern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all possible\\nmeans to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least sign for\\nthem to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island I\\nmean of human shape. Religion joined in with this prudential\\nresolution; and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly\\nout of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the\\ndestruction of innocent creatures I mean innocent as to me. As to the\\ncrimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do\\nwith them; they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice\\nof God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national\\npunishments, to make a just retribution for national offences, and to\\nbring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by\\nsuch ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to me now, that\\nnothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been\\nsuffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe would\\nhave been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if I had committed\\nit; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that He had thus\\ndelivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me the\\nprotection of His providence, that I might not fall into the hands of\\nthe barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I\\nhad a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.\\n\\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far\\nwas I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that\\nin all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there\\nwere any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on\\nshore there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my\\ncontrivances against them, or be provoked by any advantage that might\\npresent itself to fall upon them; only this I did: I went and removed\\nmy boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it\\ndown to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little\\ncove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason\\nof the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with\\ntheir boats upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried away\\neverything that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary\\nfor the bare going thither viz. a mast and sail which I had made for\\nher, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called\\neither anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its\\nkind: all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow for\\ndiscovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon\\nthe island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than\\never, and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment,\\nto milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as\\nit was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger; for\\ncertain, it is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this\\nisland, never came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and\\nconsequently never wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but\\nthey might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of\\nthem had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked back\\nwith some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been\\nif I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that; when, naked\\nand unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small\\nshot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see\\nwhat I could get; what a surprise should I have been in if, when I\\ndiscovered the print of a man s foot, I had, instead of that, seen\\nfifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the\\nswiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping them! The\\nthoughts of this sometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed\\nmy mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to think what I\\nshould have done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist\\nthem, but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I\\nmight have done; much less what now, after so much consideration and\\npreparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of\\nthese things, I would be melancholy, and sometimes it would last a\\ngreat while; but I resolved it all at last into thankfulness to that\\nProvidence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had\\nkept me from those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent\\nin delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any\\nsuch thing depending, or the least supposition of its being possible.\\nThis renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in\\nformer times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of\\nHeaven, in the dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we\\nare delivered when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a\\nquandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or\\nthat way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to\\ngo that way: nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business\\nhas called us to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the\\nmind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what power,\\nshall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear that\\nhad we gone that way, which we should have gone, and even to our\\nimagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.\\nUpon these and many like reflections I afterwards made it a certain\\nrule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of\\nmind to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going this way\\nor that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew\\nno other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon my\\nmind. I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in the\\ncourse of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my\\ninhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it is very\\nlikely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes\\nthen that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I\\ncannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with\\nsuch extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so\\nextraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let\\nthem come from what invisible intelligence they will. That I shall not\\ndiscuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are a proof\\nof the converse of spirits, and a secret communication between those\\nembodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never be\\nwithstood; of which I shall have occasion to give some remarkable\\ninstances in the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal\\nplace.\\n\\nI believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess\\nthat these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the\\nconcern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all\\nthe contrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations and\\nconveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than\\nthat of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood\\nnow, for fear the noise I might make should be heard: much less would I\\nfire a gun for the same reason: and above all I was intolerably uneasy\\nat making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great\\ndistance in the day, should betray me. For this reason, I removed that\\npart of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots and\\npipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been\\nsome time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave\\nin the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I daresay, no\\nsavage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture\\nin; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted\\nnothing so much as a safe retreat.\\n\\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by\\nmere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe\\nall such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick\\nbranches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on I must observe\\nthe reason of my making this charcoal, which was this I was afraid of\\nmaking a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could\\nnot live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I\\ncontrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under\\nturf, till it became chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out,\\nI preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services for\\nwhich fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is\\nby-the-bye. While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that,\\nbehind a very thick branch of low brushwood or underwood, there was a\\nkind of hollow place: I was curious to look in it; and getting with\\ndifficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is\\nto say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another\\nwith me: but I must confess to you that I made more haste out than I\\ndid in, when looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly\\ndark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or\\nman I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the\\ncave s mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection. However,\\nafter some pause I recovered myself, and began to call myself a\\nthousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil\\nwas not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I\\nmight well think there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful\\nthan myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand,\\nand in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not\\ngone three steps in before I was almost as frightened as before; for I\\nheard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was\\nfollowed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep\\nsigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise\\nthat it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I\\nwill not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off. But\\nstill plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself\\na little with considering that the power and presence of God was\\neverywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by\\nthe light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw\\nlying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his\\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old\\nage. I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he\\nessayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought\\nwith myself he might even lie there for if he had frightened me, so he\\nwould certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so\\nhardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.\\n\\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when\\nI found the cave was but very small that is to say, it might be about\\ntwelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square,\\nno hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere\\nNature. I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of\\nit that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep\\nupon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not;\\nso, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go\\nagain the next day provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had\\nmade of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.\\n\\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my\\nown making (for I made very good candles now of goat s tallow, but was\\nhard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and\\nsometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this\\nlow place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours as I have said, almost\\nten yards which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough,\\nconsidering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond\\nit. When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up,\\nI believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in\\nthe island, I daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of\\nthis vault or cave the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me\\nfrom my two candles. What it was in the rock whether diamonds or any\\nother precious stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be I knew\\nnot. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though\\nperfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small\\nloose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous\\ncreature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or\\nroof. The only difficulty in it was the entrance which, however, as it\\nwas a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was\\na convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and\\nresolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was\\nmost anxious about to this place: particularly, I resolved to bring\\nhither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms viz. two\\nfowling-pieces for I had three in all and three muskets for of them I\\nhad eight in all; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready\\nmounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also\\nto take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my\\nammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out\\nof the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water had\\npenetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side,\\nwhich caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel\\nin the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in\\nthe centre of the cask. This was a very agreeable discovery to me at\\nthat time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or\\nthree pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of\\nany kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.\\n\\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to\\nlive in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them;\\nfor I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages\\nwere to hunt me, they could never find me out or if they did, they\\nwould not venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found expiring\\ndied in the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery;\\nand I found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in\\nand cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him\\nthere, to prevent offence to my nose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP\\n\\n\\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and\\nwas so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I\\nbut have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place\\nto disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for\\nspending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had\\nlaid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also\\narrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time\\npass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before first, I\\nhad taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so\\nfamiliarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very\\npleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years.\\nHow long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they\\nhave a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog was\\na pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of\\nmy time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they\\nmultiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to\\nshoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all\\nI had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were\\ngone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting\\nthem have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods,\\nexcept two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young,\\nwhen they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my family.\\nBesides these I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom\\nI taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which\\ntalked pretty well, and would all call  Robin Crusoe,  but none like my\\nfirst; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had\\ndone with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew\\nnot, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little\\nstakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to\\na good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and\\nbred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I\\nbegan to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have\\nbeen secured from the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise\\ndirected; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my\\nstory to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the\\ncourse of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and\\nwhich, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is\\noftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we\\ncan be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could\\ngive many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but\\nin nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the\\ncircumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.\\n\\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\\nit), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be\\npretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning,\\neven before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a\\nlight of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two\\nmiles, toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages\\nhad been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great\\naffliction, it was on my side of the island.\\n\\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within\\nmy grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I\\nhad no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these\\nsavages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or\\ncut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately\\nconclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest\\ntill they had found me out. In this extremity I went back directly to\\nmy castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without\\nlook as wild and natural as I could.\\n\\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.\\nI loaded all my cannon, as I called them that is to say, my muskets,\\nwhich were mounted upon my new fortification and all my pistols, and\\nresolved to defend myself to the last gasp not forgetting seriously to\\ncommend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God\\nto deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this\\nposture about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence\\nabroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting a while longer,\\nand musing what I should do in this case, I was not able to bear\\nsitting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the\\nhill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then\\npulling the ladder after me, I set it up again and mounted the top of\\nthe hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on\\npurpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to\\nlook for the place. I presently found there were no less than nine\\nnaked savages sitting round a small fire they had made, not to warm\\nthem, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely hot,\\nbut, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human\\nflesh which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could\\nnot tell.\\n\\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore;\\nand as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the\\nreturn of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what\\nconfusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my\\nside of the island, and so near to me; but when I considered their\\ncoming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards\\nto be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad\\nwith safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on\\nshore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my\\nharvest work with the more composure.\\n\\nAs I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the\\nwestward I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it)\\naway. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went\\noff they were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and\\ngestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation,\\nbut that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon\\nthem; but whether they were men or women I could not distinguish.\\n\\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\\nshoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side\\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away\\nto the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as\\nsoon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I\\ncould not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived\\nthere had been three canoes more of the savages at that place; and\\nlooking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over\\nfor the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going\\ndown to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal\\nwork they had been about had left behind it viz. the blood, the bones,\\nand part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those\\nwretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at\\nthe sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the next\\nthat I saw there, let them be whom or how many soever. It seemed\\nevident to me that the visits which they made thus to this island were\\nnot very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of\\nthem came on shore there again that is to say, I neither saw them nor\\nany footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to the rainy\\nseasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far.\\nYet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant\\napprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise: from whence I\\nobserve, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the\\nsuffering, especially if there is no room to shake off that expectation\\nor those apprehensions.\\n\\nDuring all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my\\nhours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\\ncircumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see\\nthem especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,\\ninto two parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one\\nparty suppose ten or a dozen I was still the next day, or week, or\\nmonth, to kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I\\nshould be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being\\nman-eaters and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great\\nperplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or\\nother fall into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at\\nany time venture abroad, it was not without looking around me with the\\ngreatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great\\ncomfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of\\ngoats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near\\nthat side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm\\nthe savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them\\ncome again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few\\ndays, and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and\\nthree months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I\\nfound them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have\\nbeen there once or twice; but either they made no stay, or at least I\\ndid not see them; but in the month of May, as near as I could\\ncalculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange\\nencounter with them; of which in its place.\\n\\nThe perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months \\ninterval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful\\ndreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night. In the day\\ngreat troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed often of\\nkilling the savages and of the reasons why I might justify doing it.\\n\\nBut to waive all this for a while. It was in the middle of May, on the\\nsixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would\\nreckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the\\nsixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with\\na great deal of lightning and thunder, and; a very foul night it was\\nafter it. I knew not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I\\nwas reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about\\nmy present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I\\nthought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a\\ndifferent nature from any I had met with before; for the notions this\\nput into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the\\ngreatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the\\nmiddle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the\\nsecond time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of\\nfire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half\\na minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of\\nthe sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately\\nconsidered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had\\nsome comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these for\\nsignals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind at\\nthat minute to think, that though I could not help them, it might be\\nthat they might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could\\nget at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the\\nhill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew\\nvery hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there\\nwas any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it. And no doubt they\\ndid; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and\\nafter that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire\\nall night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air\\ncleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of\\nthe island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish no, not\\nwith my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still\\nsomething hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.\\n\\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and\\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my\\nhand, and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I\\nhad formerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there,\\nthe weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to\\nmy great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which\\nrocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\\ncounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the\\nmost desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my\\nlife. Thus, what is one man s safety is another man s destruction; for\\nit seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge,\\nand the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in\\nthe night, the wind blowing hard at ENE. Had they seen the island, as I\\nmust necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have\\nendeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their\\nboat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as\\nI imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined\\nthat upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their\\nboat, and endeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very\\nhigh, they might have been cast away. Other times I imagined that they\\nmight have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways;\\nparticularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many\\ntimes obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and\\nsometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other times I\\nimagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the\\nsignals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them off.\\nOther times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and\\nbeing hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were\\ncarried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery\\nand perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of\\nstarving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.\\n\\nAs all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was\\nin, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men,\\nand pity them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it\\ngave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily\\nand comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of\\ntwo ships  companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the\\nworld, not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again to\\nobserve, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into\\nany condition so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something\\nor other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances\\nthan our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could\\nnot so much as see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make\\nit rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish\\nthere, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another\\nship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw\\nnot the least sign or appearance of any such thing. I cannot explain,\\nby any possible energy of words, what a strange longing I felt in my\\nsoul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus:  Oh that there had\\nbeen but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of this ship, to\\nhave escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one\\nfellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have conversed with!  In\\nall the time of my solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong a\\ndesire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at\\nthe want of it.\\n\\nThere are some secret springs in the affections which, when they are\\nset a-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet\\nrendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion\\ncarries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager\\nembracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable. Such\\nwere these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe\\nI repeated the words,  Oh that it had been but one!  a thousand times;\\nand my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my\\nhands would clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms of my\\nhands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my hand I should have\\ncrushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike\\ntogether, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I\\ncould not part them again. Let the naturalists explain these things,\\nand the reason and manner of them. All I can do is to describe the\\nfact, which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew\\nnot from whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the effect of ardent\\nwishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort\\nwhich the conversation of one of my fellow-Christians would have been\\nto me. But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both,\\nforbade it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never\\nknew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the\\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on\\nshore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no\\nclothes on but a seaman s waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen\\ndrawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to\\nguess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pockets but two\\npieces of eight and a tobacco pipe the last was to me of ten times more\\nvalue than the first.\\n\\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to\\nthis wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might\\nbe useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the\\npossibility that there might be yet some living creature on board,\\nwhose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,\\ncomfort my own to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my\\nheart that I could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in\\nmy boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God s\\nprovidence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it\\ncould not be resisted that it must come from some invisible direction,\\nand that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go.\\n\\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,\\nprepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great\\npot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had\\nstill a great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus,\\nloading myself with everything necessary. I went down to my boat, got\\nthe water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and\\nthen went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice,\\nthe umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot of\\nwater, and about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than\\nbefore, with a bottle of goat s milk and a cheese; all which with great\\nlabour and sweat I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my\\nvoyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore,\\ncame at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.\\nAnd now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or\\nnot to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on\\nboth sides of the island at a distance, and which were very terrible to\\nme from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my\\nheart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either\\nof those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and\\nperhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as\\nmy boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should\\nbe inevitably lost.\\n\\nThese thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my\\nenterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore,\\nI stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive\\nand anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was\\nmusing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come\\non; upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this,\\npresently it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of\\nground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide\\nor currents lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if\\nI was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way\\nhome, with the same rapidity of the currents. This thought was no\\nsooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill which\\nsufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a\\nclear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to\\nguide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the current of ebb set\\nout close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood\\nset in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to\\ndo but to keep to the north side of the island in my return, and I\\nshould do well enough.\\n\\nEncouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to set out\\nwith the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my\\ncanoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a\\nlittle out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the\\ncurrent, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and\\nyet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done\\nbefore, so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a\\nstrong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the\\nwreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal\\nsight to look at; the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck\\nfast, jammed in between two rocks. All the stern and quarter of her\\nwere beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in\\nthe rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast\\nwere brought by the board that is to say, broken short off; but her\\nbowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came\\nclose to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped\\nand cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to\\nme. I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and\\nthirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a\\nravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow; I then\\ngave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have\\nlet him, he would have burst himself. After this I went on board; but\\nthe first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or\\nforecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I\\nconcluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being\\nin a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her, that the\\nmen were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant\\nrushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water.\\nBesides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor\\nany goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There\\nwere some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay\\nlower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;\\nbut they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I\\nbelieve belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into the\\nboat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship\\nbeen fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have\\nmade a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room\\nto suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may\\nguess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos\\nAyres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the\\nBrazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to\\nSpain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at\\nthat time, to anybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.\\n\\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There\\nwere several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\\nfour pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for\\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel\\nand tongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles,\\na copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,\\nand the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again and the\\nsame evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again,\\nweary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat\\nand in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave,\\nand not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all\\nmy cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of\\nliquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the\\nBrazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the\\nchests, I found several things of great use to me for example, I found\\nin one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled\\nwith cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three\\npints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good\\nsuccades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the\\nsalt-water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water\\nhad spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to\\nme; and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and\\ncoloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being\\nexceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when\\nI came to the till in the chest, I found there three great bags of\\npieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in\\none of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some\\nsmall bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a\\npound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but,\\nby the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner s mate;\\nthough there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed\\npowder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their\\nfowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this\\nvoyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner\\nof occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would\\nhave given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and\\nstockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my\\nfeet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I\\ntook off the feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I\\nfound two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to\\nme; but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or\\nservice, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this\\nseaman s chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I\\nsupposed this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to\\nbelong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money home to my\\ncave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought\\nfrom our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other\\npart of this ship had not come to my share: for I am satisfied I might\\nhave loaded my canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if\\nI ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come\\nagain and fetch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. A DREAM REALISED\\n\\n\\nHaving now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back\\nto my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old\\nharbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old\\nhabitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to\\nrepose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family\\naffairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more\\nvigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad\\nso much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always\\nto the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the\\nsavages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions,\\nand such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I\\nwent the other way.\\n\\n\\nI lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head,\\nthat was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,\\nwas all these two years filled with projects and designs how, if it\\nwere possible, I might get away from this island: for sometimes I was\\nfor making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that\\nthere was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes\\nfor a ramble one way, sometimes another and I believe verily, if I had\\nhad the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea,\\nbound anywhere, I knew not whither.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are\\ntouched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know,\\none half of their miseries flow: I mean that of not being satisfied\\nwith the station wherein God and Nature hath placed them for, not to\\nlook back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my\\nfather, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original\\nsin_, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my\\ncoming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence which so\\nhappily seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined\\ndesires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I\\nmight have been by this time I mean in the time of my being in this\\nisland one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils nay, I am\\npersuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I\\nlived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had\\nremained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores and what\\nbusiness had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation,\\nimproving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch\\nnegroes, when patience and time would have so increased our stock at\\nhome, that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose\\nbusiness it was to fetch them? and though it had cost us something\\nmore, yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at\\nso great a hazard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the\\nfolly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the\\ndear-bought experience of time so it was with me now; and yet so deep\\nhad the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy\\nmyself in my station, but was continually poring upon the means and\\npossibility of my escape from this place; and that I may, with greater\\npleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may\\nnot be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the\\nsubject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what\\nfoundation, I acted.\\n\\nI am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\\ncondition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed,\\nthan I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use\\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\\n\\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the\\nfour-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of\\nsolitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health,\\nhad no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of\\nmind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is,\\nso as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that\\nwhirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in\\nthis night s time. I ran over the whole history of my life in\\nminiature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this\\nisland, and also of that part of my life since I came to this island.\\nIn my reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on\\nthis island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the\\nfirst years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and\\ncare which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in\\nthe sand. Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the\\nisland even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them\\nat times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of\\nany apprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my\\ndanger was the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if\\nI had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with\\nmany very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How\\ninfinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its\\ngovernment of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of\\nthings; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers,\\nthe sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and\\nsink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of\\nthings hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which\\nsurround him.\\n\\nAfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to\\nreflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years\\nin this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest\\nsecurity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing\\nbut the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night,\\nhad been between me and the worst kind of destruction viz. that of\\nfalling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized\\non me with the same view as I would on a goat or turtle; and have\\nthought it no more crime to kill and devour me than I did of a pigeon\\nor a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not\\nsincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection\\nI acknowledged, with great humanity, all these unknown deliverances\\nwere due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their\\nmerciless hands.\\n\\nWhen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\\nand how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all\\nthings should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity nay, to\\nsomething so much below even brutality itself as to devour its own\\nkind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations,\\nit occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches\\nlived in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what they\\nventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and\\nwhy I might not order myself and my business so that I might be able to\\ngo over thither, as they were to come to me?\\n\\nI never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\\nmyself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the\\nhands of these savages; or how I should escape them if they attacked\\nme; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,\\nand not to be attacked by some or other of them, without any\\npossibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their\\nhands, what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my\\ncourse; none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but\\nmy mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat\\nto the mainland. I looked upon my present condition as the most\\nmiserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself\\ninto anything but death, that could be called worse; and if I reached\\nthe shore of the main I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might\\ncoast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to some\\ninhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and after all,\\nperhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in:\\nand if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an\\nend to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of\\na disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by\\nthe long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met\\nin the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near\\nobtaining what I so earnestly longed for somebody to speak to, and to\\nlearn some knowledge from them of the place where I was, and of the\\nprobable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by these\\nthoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and\\nwaiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be\\nsuspended; and I had as it were no power to turn my thoughts to\\nanything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me\\nwith such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to\\nbe resisted.\\n\\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such\\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as\\nif I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my\\nmind about it, Nature as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the\\nvery thoughts of it threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought\\nI should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to\\nit, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual from\\nmy castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to\\nland, and that they brought with them another savage whom they were\\ngoing to kill in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that\\nthey were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I\\nthought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove\\nbefore my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone,\\nand not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself\\nto him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to\\nme, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my\\nladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my\\nservant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself,  Now\\nI may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me\\nas a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for\\nprovisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what\\nplaces to venture into, and what to shun.  I waked with this thought;\\nand was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of\\nmy escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon\\ncoming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were\\nequally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great\\ndejection of spirits.\\n\\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to go\\nabout to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my\\npossession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom\\nthey had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But\\nthese thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: that it was\\nimpossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them,\\nand killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt,\\nand might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the\\nlawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of\\nshedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not\\nrepeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the\\nsame mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now viz.\\nthat those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they\\ncould; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver\\nmyself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as\\nmuch as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say though\\nthese things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood\\nfor my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no\\nmeans reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after\\nmany secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it\\n(for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a\\nlong time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length\\nmastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these\\nsavages into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to\\ncontrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve\\non; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved\\nto put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and\\nleave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity\\nshould present, let what would be.\\n\\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\\noften as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it;\\nfor it was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of\\nthat time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the\\nisland almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This\\nwas very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot\\nsay that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off\\nthe edge of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be\\ndelayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so\\ncareful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by\\nthem, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself\\nable to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to\\nmake them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,\\nand to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a\\ngreat while that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still\\npresented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no\\nsavages came near me for a great while.\\n\\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long\\nmusing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an\\noccasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by\\nseeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the\\nisland, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my\\nsight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many,\\nand knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a\\nboat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures\\nto attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my\\ncastle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into the same\\nposition for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready\\nfor action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while,\\nlistening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very\\nimpatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to\\nthe top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however,\\nthat my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not\\nperceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my\\nperspective glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that\\nthey had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had\\ncooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I\\nknow not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round\\nthe fire.\\n\\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\\nthem immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\\nwooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at\\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.\\nIn that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at\\nliberty and unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he\\nstarted away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the\\nsands, directly towards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where\\nmy habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,\\nwhen I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I\\nsaw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my\\ndream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in\\nmy grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the\\nother savages would not pursue him thither and find him there. However,\\nI kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that\\nthere was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I\\nencouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in\\nrunning, and gained ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out\\nfor half-an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.\\n\\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the\\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\\nwretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither,\\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran\\nwith exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to\\nthe creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but\\nwent no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it\\nhappened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two who\\nswam were yet more than twice as strong swimming over the creek as the\\nfellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts,\\nand indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant,\\nand, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called\\nby Providence to save this poor creature s life. I immediately ran down\\nthe ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they\\nwere both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting\\nup again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards\\nthe sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself\\nin the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him\\nthat fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened\\nat me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and,\\nin the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then\\nrushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of\\nmy piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear;\\nthough, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and\\nbeing out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what to\\nmake of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him\\nstopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards him: but\\nas I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was\\nfitting it to shoot at me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him first,\\nwhich I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who\\nfled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and\\nkilled, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of\\nmy piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went\\nbackward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come\\non. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he\\neasily understood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and then\\na little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he\\nstood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to\\nbe killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to\\nme, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of;\\nand he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps,\\nin token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and\\nlooked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length\\nhe came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\\nand laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my\\nfoot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my\\nslave for ever. I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him\\nall I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the\\nsavage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the\\nblow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him\\nthe savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to me,\\nand though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were\\npleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man s voice that I\\nhad heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was\\nno time for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down\\nrecovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived\\nthat my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my\\nother piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage,\\nfor so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which\\nhung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner had it, but\\nhe runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly, no\\nexecutioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I\\nthought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a\\nsword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however, it\\nseems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp,\\nso heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads\\nwith them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow, too. When he had done\\nthis, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the\\nsword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,\\nlaid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just\\nbefore me. But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed\\nthe other Indian so far off; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me\\nto let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I could. When he\\ncame to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him\\nfirst on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet\\nhad made, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a\\nhole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled\\ninwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and\\ncame back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me,\\nmaking signs to him that more might come after them. Upon this he made\\nsigns to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be\\nseen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to\\ndo so. He fell to work; and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the\\nsand with his hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged\\nhim into it, and covered him; and did so by the other also; I believe\\nhe had him buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then, calling\\naway, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on\\nthe farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass\\nin that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him\\nbread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I\\nfound he was indeed in great distress for, from his running: and having\\nrefreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep,\\nshowing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket\\nupon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor\\ncreature lay down, and went to sleep.\\n\\nHe was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight,\\nstrong limbs, not too large; tall, and well-shaped; and, as I reckon,\\nabout twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a\\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his\\nface; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in\\nhis countenance, too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and\\nblack, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a\\ngreat vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his\\nskin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow,\\nnauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of\\nAmerica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it\\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face\\nwas round and plump; his nose small, not flat, like the negroes; a very\\ngood mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as\\nivory.\\n\\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour, he awoke\\nagain, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats\\nwhich I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me he came running\\nto me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible\\nsigns of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic\\ngestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,\\nclose to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done\\nbefore; and after this made all the signs to me of subjection,\\nservitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve\\nme so long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him\\nknow I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to\\nspeak to him; and teach him to speak to me; and first, I let him know\\nhis name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; I called\\nhim so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master;\\nand then let him know that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to\\nsay Yes and No and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in\\nan earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my\\nbread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he\\nquickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I\\nkept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day I\\nbeckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him some\\nclothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we\\nwent by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly\\nto the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them\\nagain, making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat\\nthem. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,\\nmade as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my\\nhand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great\\nsubmission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his\\nenemies were gone; and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly\\nthe place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their\\ncanoes; so that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two\\ncomrades behind them, without any search after them.\\n\\nBut I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving\\nhim the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I\\nfound he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,\\nand I two for myself; and away we marched to the place where these\\ncreatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some further\\nintelligence of them. When I came to the place my very blood ran chill\\nin my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the\\nspectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,\\nthough Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human\\nbones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left\\nhere and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all\\nthe tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a\\nvictory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the\\nbones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of\\nthe bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they\\nbrought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were\\neaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there\\nhad been a great battle between them and their next king, of whose\\nsubjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great\\nnumber of prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those\\nwho had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was\\ndone here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.\\n\\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\\nremained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon\\nit, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering\\nstomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his\\nnature; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and\\nat the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I\\nhad, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered\\nit.\\n\\nWhen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to\\nwork for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner s chest I mentioned, which\\nI found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him\\nvery well; and then I made him a jerkin of goat s skin, as well as my\\nskill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I\\ngave him a cap which I made of hare s skin, very convenient, and\\nfashionable enough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably\\nwell, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed\\nas his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first:\\nwearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the\\nwaistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little\\neasing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to\\nthem, he took to them at length very well.\\n\\nThe next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to\\nconsider where I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him and\\nyet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the\\nvacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last,\\nand in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there\\ninto my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of\\nboards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance;\\nand, causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the\\nnight, taking in my ladders, too; so that Friday could no way come at\\nme in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in\\ngetting over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had now a\\ncomplete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning\\nup to the side of the hill; which was again laid across with smaller\\nsticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with\\nthe rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place\\nwhich was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of\\ntrap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not\\nhave opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great\\nnoise as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But I\\nneeded none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faithful,\\nloving, sincere servant than Friday was to me: without passions,\\nsullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very\\naffections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and I\\ndaresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any\\noccasion whatsoever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out\\nof doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for\\nmy safety on his account.\\n\\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\\nhowever it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of\\nthe works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of\\nHis creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of\\ntheir souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same\\npowers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of\\nkindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,\\nthe same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the\\ncapacities of doing good and receiving good that He has given to us;\\nand that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these,\\nthey are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for\\nwhich they were bestowed than we are. This made me very melancholy\\nsometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean\\na use we make of all these, even though we have these powers\\nenlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by\\nthe knowledge of His word added to our understanding; and why it has\\npleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of\\nsouls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much\\nbetter use of it than we did. From hence I sometimes was led too far,\\nto invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the\\njustice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that\\nsight from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty\\nfrom both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this\\nconclusion: first, that we did not know by what light and law these\\nshould be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature\\nof His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if\\nthese creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on\\naccount of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says, was\\na law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would\\nacknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us;\\nand secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the\\npotter, no vessel could say to him,  Why hast thou formed me thus? \\n\\nBut to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with him,\\nand made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make\\nhim useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\\nunderstand me when I spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever\\nwas; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so\\npleased when he could but understand me, or make me understand him,\\nthat it was very pleasant for me to talk to him. Now my life began to\\nbe so easy that I began to say to myself that could I but have been\\nsafe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the\\nplace where I lived.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. FRIDAY S EDUCATION\\n\\n\\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought\\nthat, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and\\nfrom the relish of a cannibal s stomach, I ought to let him taste other\\nflesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,\\nindeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock; and bring it home\\nand dress it; but as I was going I saw a she-goat lying down in the\\nshade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday.\\n Hold,  said I,  stand still;  and made signs to him not to stir:\\nimmediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The\\npoor creature, who had at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage,\\nhis enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine how it was done, was\\nsensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I\\nthought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or\\nperceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether\\nhe was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved\\nto kill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my\\nknees, said a great many things I did not understand; but I could\\neasily see the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.\\n\\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid\\nwhich I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did:\\nand while he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was\\nkilled, I loaded my gun again. By-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a\\nhawk, sitting upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a\\nlittle what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl,\\nwhich was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,\\npointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the\\nparrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that\\nI would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him\\nlook, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one\\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he\\nwas the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the\\ngun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and\\ndestruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything\\nnear or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such as\\ncould not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let\\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he\\nwould not so much as touch it for several days after; but he would\\nspeak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by\\nhimself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to\\nkill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I\\npointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but\\nstayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered\\naway a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found\\nher, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his\\nignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun\\nagain, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any\\nother mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time:\\nso I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off,\\nand cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that\\npurpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good\\nbroth. After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who seemed\\nvery glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest\\nto him was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the\\nsalt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he\\nseemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his\\nmouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat\\ninto my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for\\nwant of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not do;\\nhe would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not\\nfor a great while, and then but a very little.\\n\\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast\\nhim the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging\\nit before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in\\nEngland, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one\\nacross the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the\\nmeat turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came\\nto taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked\\nit, that I could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as\\nwell as he could, he would never eat man s flesh any more, which I was\\nvery glad to hear.\\n\\nThe next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and sifting it in\\nthe manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood\\nhow to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the\\nmeaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that I\\nlet him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time\\nFriday was able to do all the work for me as well as I could do it\\nmyself.\\n\\nI began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one,\\nI must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity\\nof corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and\\nbegan the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked\\nnot only very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and\\nI told him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,\\nbecause he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and\\nmyself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know\\nthat he thought I had much more labour upon me on his account than I\\nhad for myself; and that he would work the harder for me if I would\\ntell him what to do.\\n\\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\\nFriday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\\neverything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\\nhim to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now\\nto have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\\noccasion for before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a\\nsingular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned\\nhonesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to\\nlove the creature; and on his side I believe he loved me more than it\\nwas possible for him ever to love anything before.\\n\\nI had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country\\nagain; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me\\nalmost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to\\nnever conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said Yes, yes, we\\nalways fight the better;  that is, he meant always get the better in\\nfight; and so we began the following discourse: \\n\\n_Master_. You always fight the better; how came you to be taken\\nprisoner, then, Friday?\\n\\n_Friday_. My nation beat much for all that.\\n\\n_Master_. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\\n\\n_Friday_. They more many than my nation, in the place where me was;\\nthey take one, two, three, and me: my nation over-beat them in the\\nyonder place, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great\\nthousand.\\n\\n_Master_. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\\nenemies, then?\\n\\n_Friday_. They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe;\\nmy nation have no canoe that time.\\n\\n_Master_. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\\ntake? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\\n\\n_Master_. Where do they carry them?\\n\\n_Friday_. Go to other place, where they think.\\n\\n_Master_. Do they come hither?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\\n\\n_Master_. Have you been here with them?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, I have been here (points to the NW. side of the island,\\nwhich, it seems, was their side).\\n\\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\\nthe same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and some time\\nafter, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the\\nsame I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he\\nwas there once, when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child;\\nhe could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying so\\nmany stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\\n\\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows: that\\nafter this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from\\nour island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He\\ntold me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost: but that after a\\nlittle way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in\\nthe morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no\\nmore than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I\\nafterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux\\nof the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I\\nfound afterwards, our island lay; and that this land, which I perceived\\nto be W. and NW., was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of\\nthe mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the\\ncountry, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were\\nnear; he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable. I\\nasked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but\\ncould get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood\\nthat these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of\\nAmerica which reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to Guiana,\\nand onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the\\nmoon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from\\ntheir country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to\\nmy great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed\\nmuch mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he meant the\\nSpaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole\\ncountry, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.\\n\\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get\\namong those white men. He told me,  Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe. \\nI could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what\\nhe meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he\\nmeant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of\\nFriday s discourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I\\nentertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an\\nopportunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor\\nsavage might be a means to help me.\\n\\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he\\nbegan to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a\\nfoundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him\\none time, who made him. The creature did not understand me at all, but\\nthought I had asked who was his father but I took it up by another\\nhandle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and\\nthe hills and woods. He told me,  It was one Benamuckee, that lived\\nbeyond all;  he could describe nothing of this great person, but that\\nhe was very old,  much older,  he said,  than the sea or land, than the\\nmoon or the stars.  I asked him then, if this old person had made all\\nthings, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and,\\nwith a perfect look of innocence, said,  All things say O to him.  I\\nasked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere? He\\nsaid,  Yes; they all went to Benamuckee.  Then I asked him whether\\nthose they eat up went thither too. He said,  Yes. \\n\\nFrom these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\\nGod; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\\npointing up towards heaven; that He governed the world by the same\\npower and providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and\\ncould do everything for us, give everything to us, take everything from\\nus; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great\\nattention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being\\nsent to redeem us; and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and\\nHis being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if\\nour God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater\\nGod than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet\\ncould not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt\\nto speak to them. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him.\\nHe said,  No; they never went that were young men; none went thither\\nbut the old men,  whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made\\nhim explain to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to\\nsay O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back and told them\\nwhat Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is priestcraft\\neven among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the\\npolicy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the\\nveneration of the people to the clergy, not only to be found in the\\nRoman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among the\\nmost brutish and barbarous savages.\\n\\nI endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him\\nthat the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O\\nto their god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from\\nthence what he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer,\\nor spake with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I\\nentered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of\\nhim, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it,\\nhis setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped\\ninstead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to\\ndelude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our\\npassions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our\\ninclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run\\nupon our destruction by our own choice.\\n\\nI found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about\\nthe devil as it was about the being of a God. Nature assisted all my\\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,\\nan overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of\\nthe equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the\\nlike; but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil\\nspirit, of his origin, his being, his nature, and above all, of his\\ninclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor\\ncreature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural\\nand innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking\\na great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion\\nto sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as\\nHe had made us all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment;\\nand he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After this\\nI had been telling him how the devil was God s enemy in the hearts of\\nmen, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of\\nProvidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the\\nlike.  Well,  says Friday,  but you say God is so strong, so great; is\\nHe not much strong, much might as the devil?   Yes, yes,  says I,\\n Friday; God is stronger than the devil God is above the devil, and\\ntherefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable\\nus to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts.   But,  says\\nhe again,  if God much stronger, much might as the wicked devil, why\\nGod no kill the devil, so make him no more do wicked?  I was strangely\\nsurprised at this question; and, after all, though I was now an old\\nman, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist or a\\nsolver of difficulties; and at first I could not tell what to say; so I\\npretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too\\nearnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in\\nthe very same broken words as above. By this time I had recovered\\nmyself a little, and I said,  God will at last punish him severely; he\\nis reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless\\npit, to dwell with everlasting fire.  This did not satisfy Friday; but\\nhe returns upon me, repeating my words,  _Reserve at last_!  me no\\nunderstand but why not kill the devil now; not kill great ago?   You\\nmay as well ask me,  said I,  why God does not kill you or me, when we\\ndo wicked things here that offend Him we are preserved to repent and be\\npardoned.  He mused some time on this.  Well, well,  says he, mighty\\naffectionately,  that well so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve,\\nrepent, God pardon all.  Here I was run down again by him to the last\\ndegree; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,\\nthough they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,\\nand of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the\\nconsequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form\\nthe knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us; of a\\nMediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of\\nGod s throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form\\nthese in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and\\nSaviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God,\\npromised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely\\nnecessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of\\nGod and the means of salvation.\\n\\nI therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man,\\nrising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then\\nsending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God\\nthat He would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage;\\nassisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to\\nreceive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to\\nHimself, and would guide me so to speak to him from the Word of God\\nthat his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul\\nsaved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with\\nhim upon the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the\\nworld, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from Heaven, viz. of\\nrepentance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then\\nexplained to him as well as I could why our blessed Redeemer took not\\non Him the nature of angels but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that\\nreason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that He came\\nonly to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.\\n\\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I\\ntook for this poor creature s instruction, and must acknowledge, what I\\nbelieve all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying\\nthings open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many\\nthings that either I did not know or had not fully considered before,\\nbut which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for\\nthe information of this poor savage; and I had more affection in my\\ninquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so\\nthat, whether this poor wild wretch was better for me or no, I had\\ngreat reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat\\nlighter, upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure:\\nand when I reflected that in this solitary life which I have been\\nconfined to, I had not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and\\nto seek the Hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made an\\ninstrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew,\\nthe soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of\\nreligion and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ\\nJesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all these\\nthings, a secret joy ran through every part of My soul, and I\\nfrequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had\\nso often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could\\npossibly have befallen me.\\n\\nI continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and\\nthe conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was\\nsuch as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly\\nand completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be\\nformed in a sublunary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a\\nmuch better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it,\\nthat we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We\\nhad here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to\\ninstruct than if we had been in England. I always applied myself, in\\nreading the Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning\\nof what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries and\\nquestionings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the\\nScripture knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere private\\nreading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also, from\\nexperience in this retired part of my life, viz. how infinite and\\ninexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the\\ndoctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the\\nWord of God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare\\nreading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my\\nduty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance\\nfor my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a\\nstated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God s commands,\\nand this without any teacher or instructor, I mean human; so the same\\nplain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage\\ncreature, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few\\nequal to him in my life.\\n\\nAs to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have\\nhappened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines or\\nschemes of church government, they were all perfectly useless to us,\\nand, for aught I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the\\nworld. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God; and we\\nhad, blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching\\nand instructing by His word, leading us into all truth, and making us\\nboth willing and obedient to the instruction of His word. And I cannot\\nsee the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of\\nreligion, which have made such confusion in the world, would have been\\nto us, if we could have obtained it. But I must go on with the\\nhistorical part of things, and take every part in its order.\\n\\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could\\nunderstand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though\\nin broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at\\nleast so much of it as related to my coming to this place: how I had\\nlived there, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such it was\\nto him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave\\nhim a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a\\nbelt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in;\\nand in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was\\nnot only as good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon\\nother occasions.\\n\\nI described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I\\ncame from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one\\nanother, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave\\nhim an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed\\nhim, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all\\nbeaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat,\\nwhich we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole\\nstrength then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing\\nthis boat, Friday stood, musing a great while, and said nothing. I\\nasked him what it was he studied upon. At last says he,  Me see such\\nboat like come to place at my nation.  I did not understand him a good\\nwhile; but at last, when I had examined further into it, I understood\\nby him that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the\\ncountry where he lived: that is, as he explained it, was driven thither\\nby stress of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must\\nhave been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and\\ndrive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of men making\\ntheir escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so\\nI only inquired after a description of the boat.\\n\\nFriday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to\\nunderstand him when he added with some warmth,  We save the white mans\\nfrom drown.  Then I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he\\ncalled them, in the boat.  Yes,  he said;  the boat full of white\\nmans.  I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I\\nasked him then what became of them. He told me,  They live, they dwell\\nat my nation. \\n\\nThis put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these\\nmight be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight\\nof my island, as I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on\\nthe rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in\\ntheir boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.\\nUpon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them. He\\nassured me they lived still there; that they had been there about four\\nyears; that the savages left them alone, and gave them victuals to live\\non. I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat\\nthem. He said,  No, they make brother with them;  that is, as I\\nunderstood him, a truce; and then he added,  They no eat mans but when\\nmake the war fight;  that is to say, they never eat any men but such as\\ncome to fight with them and are taken in battle.\\n\\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of\\nthe hill at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I\\nhad, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of America,\\nFriday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the\\nmainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and\\ncalls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what\\nwas the matter.  Oh, joy!  says he;  Oh, glad! there see my country,\\nthere my nation!  I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure\\nappeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance\\ndiscovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own\\ncountry again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into\\nme, which made me at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was\\nbefore; and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his\\nown nation again, he would not only forget all his religion but all his\\nobligation to me, and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an\\naccount of me, and come back, perhaps with a hundred or two of them,\\nand make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to\\nbe with those of his enemies when they were taken in war. But I wronged\\nthe poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry\\nafterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held some weeks, I\\nwas a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as\\nbefore: in which I was certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful\\ncreature having no thought about it but what consisted with the best\\nprinciples, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, as\\nappeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.\\n\\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day\\npumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I\\nsuspected were in him; but I found everything he said was so honest and\\nso innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and in\\nspite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again;\\nnor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I\\ncould not suspect him of deceit.\\n\\nOne day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea,\\nso that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said,\\n Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own\\nnation?   Yes,  he said,  I be much O glad to be at my own nation. \\n What would you do there?  said I.  Would you turn wild again, eat\\nmen s flesh again, and be a savage as you were before?  He looked full\\nof concern, and shaking his head, said,  No, no, Friday tell them to\\nlive good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle\\nflesh, milk; no eat man again.   Why, then,  said I to him,  they will\\nkill you.  He looked grave at that, and then said,  No, no, they no\\nkill me, they willing love learn.  He meant by this, they would be\\nwilling to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans that\\ncame in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He\\nsmiled at that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I told him I\\nwould make a canoe for him. He told me he would go if I would go with\\nhim.  I go!  says I;  why, they will eat me if I come there.   No, no, \\nsays he,  me make they no eat you; me make they much love you.  He\\nmeant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his\\nlife, and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he\\ncould, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he\\ncalled them who came on shore there in distress.\\n\\nFrom this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I\\ncould possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were\\nSpaniards and Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find\\nsome method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good\\ncompany together, better than I could from an island forty miles off\\nthe shore, alone and without help. So, after some days, I took Friday\\nto work again by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat\\nto go back to his own nation; and, accordingly, I carried him to my\\nfrigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared\\nit of water (for I always kept it sunk in water), I brought it out,\\nshowed it him, and we both went into it. I found he was a most\\ndexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift\\nagain as I could. So when he was in, I said to him,  Well, now, Friday,\\nshall we go to your nation?  He looked very dull at my saying so; which\\nit seems was because he thought the boat was too small to go so far. I\\nthen told him I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place where\\nthe first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into the\\nwater. He said that was big enough; but then, as I had taken no care of\\nit, and it had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had so\\nsplit and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me such a boat\\nwould do very well, and would carry  much enough vittle, drink, bread; \\nthis was his way of talking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. RESCUE OF PRISONERS FROM CANNIBALS\\n\\n\\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going\\nover with him to the continent that I told him we would go and make one\\nas big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word,\\nbut looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with\\nhim. He asked me again,  Why you angry mad with Friday? what me done? \\nI asked him what he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all.\\n No angry!  says he, repeating the words several times;  why send\\nFriday home away to my nation?   Why,  says I,  Friday, did not you say\\nyou wished you were there?   Yes, yes,  says he,  wish we both there;\\nno wish Friday there, no master there.  In a word, he would not think\\nof going there without me.  I go there, Friday?  says I;  what shall I\\ndo there?  He turned very quick upon me at this.  You do great deal\\nmuch good,  says he;  you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;\\nyou tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.   Alas, Friday! \\nsays I,  thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man\\nmyself.   Yes, yes,  says he,  you teachee me good, you teachee them\\ngood.   No, no, Friday,  says I,  you shall go without me; leave me\\nhere to live by myself, as I did before.  He looked confused again at\\nthat word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he\\ntakes it up hastily, and gives it to me.  What must I do with this? \\nsays I to him.  You take kill Friday,  says he.  What must kill you\\nfor?  said I again. He returns very quick What you send Friday away\\nfor? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.  This he spoke so earnestly\\nthat I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered\\nthe utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I\\ntold him then and often after, that I would never send him away from me\\nif he was willing to stay with me.\\n\\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to\\nme, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the\\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his\\nardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a\\nthing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least\\nthought or intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a\\nstrong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition\\ngathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men\\nthere; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with\\nFriday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large\\nperiagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in\\nthe island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes,\\nbut even of good, large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to\\nget one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to\\navoid the mistake I committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a\\ntree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was\\nfittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree\\nwe cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or\\nbetween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour\\nand smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out,\\nto make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools;\\nwhich, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in\\nabout a month s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome;\\nespecially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we\\ncut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this,\\nhowever, it cost us near a fortnight s time to get her along, as it\\nwere inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was\\nin, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.\\n\\nWhen she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see\\nwith what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn\\nher, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might\\nventure over in her.  Yes,  he said,  we venture over in her very well,\\nthough great blow wind.  However I had a further design that he knew\\nnothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her\\nwith an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so\\nI pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the\\nplace, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set\\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and\\norder it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had\\nold sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them\\nnow six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to\\npreserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use\\nfor them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most\\nof them were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty\\ngood, and with these I went to work; and with a great deal of pains,\\nand awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at\\nlength made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a\\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little\\nshort sprit at the top, such as usually our ships  long-boats sail\\nwith, and such as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I\\nhad to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in\\nthe first part of my story.\\n\\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and\\nfitting my masts and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a\\nsmall stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if we should turn\\nto windward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern\\nof her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew\\nthe usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself\\nwith so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though,\\nconsidering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I\\nthink it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.\\n\\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what\\nbelonged to the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how to\\npaddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a\\nrudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and\\nagain in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this\\nway or that way as the course we sailed changed; I say when he saw this\\nhe stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I\\nmade all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor,\\nexcept that of the compass I could make him understand very little. On\\nthe other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or\\nnever any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a\\ncompass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the\\nshore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to\\nstir abroad either by land or sea.\\n\\nI was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in\\nthis place; though the three last years that I had this creature with\\nme ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being\\nquite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the\\nanniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for\\nHis mercies as at first: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at\\nfirst, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies of\\nthe care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being\\neffectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression\\nupon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not\\nbe another year in this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry;\\ndigging, planting, and fencing as usual. I gathered and cured my\\ngrapes, and did every necessary thing as before.\\n\\nThe rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within\\ndoors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we\\ncould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the\\nbeginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the\\nshore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just\\nbig enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough\\nto float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam\\nacross the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay, dry as to\\nthe tide from the sea: and to keep the rain off we laid a great many\\nboughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house; and\\nthus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I\\ndesigned to make my adventure.\\n\\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design\\nreturned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage.\\nAnd the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of\\nprovisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended in a week or\\na fortnight s time to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was\\nbusy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday,\\nand bid him to go to the sea-shore and see if he could find a turtle or\\na tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of\\nthe eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he\\ncame running back, and flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that\\nfelt not the ground or the steps he set his foot on; and before I had\\ntime to speak to him he cries out to me,  O master! O master! O sorrow!\\nO bad! What s the matter, Friday?  says I.  O yonder there,  says he,\\n one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!  By this way of speaking I\\nconcluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three.\\n Well, Friday,  says I,  do not be frightened.  So I heartened him up\\nas well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\\nscared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for\\nhim, and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow\\ntrembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him\\nas well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and\\nthat they would eat me as well as him.  But,  says I,  Friday, we must\\nresolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?   Me shoot,  says he,\\n but there come many great number.   No matter for that,  said I again;\\n our guns will fright them that we do not kill.  So I asked him\\nwhether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by\\nme, and do just as I bid him. He said,  Me die when you bid die,\\nmaster.  So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I\\nhad been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left. When\\nwe had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we\\nalways carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small\\npistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\\nbrace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\\nside, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I\\ntook my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see\\nwhat I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were\\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that\\ntheir whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these\\nthree human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than,\\nas I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also that they had\\nlanded, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer\\nto my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came\\nalmost close down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman\\nerrand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that\\nI came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to\\nthem and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had\\nnow got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the\\ndram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he\\nwould die when I bid die.\\n\\nIn this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,\\nbetween us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three\\nguns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns\\nmyself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of\\nrum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and\\nbullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and\\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the\\nmeantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my\\nright hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into\\nthe wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be\\ndiscovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.\\n\\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\\nnumber, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\\nsuperior to them nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my\\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in\\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done\\nor intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token,\\nindeed, of God s having left them, with the other nations of that part\\nof the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did\\nnot call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less\\nan executioner of His justice that whenever He thought fit He would\\ntake the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish\\nthem as a people for national crimes, but that, in the meantime, it was\\nnone of my business that it was true Friday might justify it, because\\nhe was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very\\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them but I could\\nnot say the same with regard to myself. These things were so warmly\\npressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would\\nonly go and place myself near them that I might observe their barbarous\\nfeast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless\\nsomething offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I\\nwould not meddle with them.\\n\\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible\\nwariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched\\ntill I came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to\\nthem, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I\\ncalled softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at\\nthe corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if\\nhe could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came\\nimmediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed\\nthere that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of\\ntheir prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from\\nthem, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very soul\\nwithin me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the\\nbearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat.\\nI was filled with horror at the very naming of the white bearded man;\\nand going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay\\nupon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags,\\nor things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\\n\\nThere was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty\\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I\\nshould be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though\\nI was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\\nthe other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me\\na full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards.\\n\\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by\\nlimb to their fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at\\nhis feet. I turned to Friday.  Now, Friday,  said I,  do as I bid\\nthee.  Friday said he would.  Then, Friday,  says I,  do exactly as you\\nsee me do; fail in nothing.  So I set down one of the muskets and the\\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with\\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the\\nlike; then asking him if he was ready, he said,  Yes.   Then fire at\\nthem,  said I; and at the same moment I fired also.\\n\\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\\nshot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I\\nkilled one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\\nconsternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their\\nfeet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to\\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept\\nhis eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I\\ndid; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece,\\nand took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock\\nand present; he did the same again.  Are you ready, Friday?  said I.\\n Yes,  says he.  Let fly, then,  says I,  in the name of God!  and with\\nthat I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as\\nour pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small\\npistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded that\\nthey ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody,\\nand most of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly\\nafter, though not quite dead.\\n\\n Now, Friday,  says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\\nthe musket which was yet loaded,  follow me,  which he did with a great\\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,\\nand Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\\nshouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as\\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded\\nwith arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,\\nas I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they\\nsat and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with him\\nhad left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible\\nfright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of\\nthe rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step\\nforwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running\\nabout forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he\\nhad killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat,\\nthough I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of\\nthem, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the\\nboat as if he had been dead.\\n\\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He\\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\\nscarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it\\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\\npiece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was:\\nand he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for\\nhis deliverance.  Seignior,  said I, with as much Spanish as I could\\nmake up,  we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have\\nany strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.  He\\ntook them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands,\\nbut, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers\\nlike a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the\\ntruth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures\\nwere so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell\\ndown for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt\\ntheir own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was\\nthe case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of\\nthem fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the\\nfright.\\n\\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep\\nmy charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:\\nso I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we\\nfirst fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been\\ndischarged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving him my\\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them\\ncome to me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there\\nhappened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the\\nsavages, who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the\\nweapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it.\\nThe Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though\\nweak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great wounds\\non his head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in\\nwith him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword\\nout of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting\\nthe sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the\\nbody, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help\\nhim, could come near him.\\n\\nFriday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches,\\nwith no weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that he despatched\\nthose three who as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,\\nand all the rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me\\nfor a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued\\ntwo of the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to\\nrun, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,\\nand killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and\\nthough he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam\\nwith all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which\\nthree in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died\\nor no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account\\nof the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from the\\ntree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat;\\ntwo killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in\\nthe wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found\\ndropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase\\nof them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not\\ndead twenty-one in all.\\n\\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he\\nhit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\\ncanoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their\\nescape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they should come\\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by\\nmere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to\\none of their canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me: but when I\\nwas in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor creature lie\\nthere, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and\\nalmost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not\\nbeen able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard\\nneck and heels, and had been tied so long that he had really but little\\nlife in him.\\n\\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him\\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,\\nbut groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was\\nonly unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him\\nspeak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my\\nbottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of\\nhis being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when\\nFriday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have\\nmoved any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced\\nhim, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang;\\nthen cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then\\nsang and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good\\nwhile before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the\\nmatter; but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his\\nfather.\\n\\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy\\nand filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I\\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this: for he\\nwent into the boat and out of the boat a great many times: when he went\\nin to him he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his\\nfather s head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish\\nit; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with\\nthe binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,\\nperceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub\\nthem with, which did them a great deal of good.\\n\\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\\nsavages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that\\nwe did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they\\ncould be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all\\nnight, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I\\ncould not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached\\ntheir own coast.\\n\\nBut to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I could\\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought\\nhe could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping\\nand laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if\\nhe had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said,  None;\\nugly dog eat all up self.  I then gave him a cake of bread out of a\\nlittle pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself;\\nbut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my\\npocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them\\nfor his father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins but I\\nsaw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched,\\nfor he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he\\nran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;\\nand though I called, and hallooed out too after him, it was all\\none away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back\\nagain, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer I found his\\npace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up to\\nme I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring\\nhis father some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or\\nloaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his\\nfather; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The\\nwater revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given\\nhim, for he was fainting with thirst.\\n\\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any\\nwater left. He said,  Yes ; and I bade him give it to the poor\\nSpaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one\\nof the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed\\nvery weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade\\nof a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled\\nwith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon\\nFriday s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the\\nbread and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of\\nraisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and\\nthankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak,\\nnotwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could\\nnot stand up upon his feet he tried to do it two or three times, but\\nwas really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him;\\nso I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe\\nthem with rum, as he had done his father s.\\n\\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or\\nperhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if\\nhis father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;\\nand at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,\\nand, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one\\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when\\nhe came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so\\nFriday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to\\nlet Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.\\nBut Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back,\\nand carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side\\nor gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then\\nlifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently\\nstepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the\\nshore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too;\\nso he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the\\nboat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to\\nhim, and asked him whither he went. He told me,  Go fetch more boat; \\nso away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like\\nhim; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to\\nit by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests\\nout of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to\\nwalk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\\n\\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind\\nof hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\\ntogether upon it between us.\\n\\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them\\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again,\\nand Friday and I, in about two hours  time, made a very handsome tent,\\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in\\nthe space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of\\nyoung wood which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such\\nthings as I had viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to\\nlie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.\\n\\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king\\nI looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that\\nI had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were\\nperfectly subjected I was absolutely lord and lawgiver they all owed\\ntheir lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had\\nbeen occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three\\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions my man Friday was\\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\\nwas a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\\ndominions. But this is by the way.\\n\\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them\\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made\\nthem a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I\\ncooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I\\ncarried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for\\nthem, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as\\nI could, cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter,\\nespecially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the\\nSpaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.\\n\\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\\nthe canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for\\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I\\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him\\nto bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not\\nthink of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that\\nway; all which he punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance\\nof the savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce\\nknow where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to\\nthe place.\\n\\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\\nsubjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we\\nmight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.\\nHis first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live\\nout the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of\\nnecessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they\\nwere as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were\\ncast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he\\nsaid he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully\\nfrightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the\\nfire, that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed\\nby thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two\\nwhich appeared viz. Friday and I were two heavenly spirits, or furies,\\ncome down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he\\nknew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to\\nanother; for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could\\ndart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting\\nup the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the right;\\nfor, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages never attempted\\nto go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with the\\naccounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the\\nsea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be\\ndestroyed with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and\\ntherefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept\\nalways upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of\\nus, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open\\nfield, at any time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. VISIT OF MUTINEERS\\n\\n\\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\\ncoming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to\\nthe main into consideration; being likewise assured by Friday s father\\nthat I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account,\\nif I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a\\nserious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there\\nwere sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been\\ncast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace,\\nindeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,\\nand, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage,\\nand found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to\\nthe Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was\\nchiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they\\ncould meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,\\nwhom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men were\\ndrowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through\\ninfinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the\\ncannibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every moment.\\nHe told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly\\nuseless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the\\nsea having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at\\ntheir first landing to provide themselves with some food.\\n\\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had\\nformed any design of making their escape. He said they had many\\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor tools to\\nbuild one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in\\ntears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a\\nproposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if\\nthey were all here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I\\nfeared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in\\ntheir hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of\\nman, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they\\nhad received so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I\\ntold him it would be very hard that I should be made the instrument of\\ntheir deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their\\nprisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a\\nsacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither;\\nand that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured\\nalive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be\\ncarried into the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded,\\nif they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a barque\\nlarge enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or\\nto the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital,\\nthey should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force\\namong their own people, I might be ill-used for my kindness to them,\\nand make my case worse than it was before.\\n\\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that\\nhe believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he\\nwould go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,\\nand return again and bring me their answer; that he would make\\nconditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be\\nabsolutely under my direction as their commander and captain; and they\\nshould swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and\\ngo to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to\\nbe directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed\\nsafely in such country as I intended, and that he would bring a\\ncontract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told\\nme he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me\\nas long as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take my\\nside to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least\\nbreach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them\\nvery civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest distress\\nimaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at\\nthe mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever\\nreturning to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would\\nundertake their relief, they would live and die by me.\\n\\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to\\ntreat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard\\nhimself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one\\nhand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be\\nvery well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance\\nof his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus: he had\\nbeen with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in\\nwhat manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my\\nsupport; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid\\nup; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was\\nnot sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was\\nincreased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his\\ncountrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come\\nover; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if\\nwe should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of\\nAmerica; so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him\\nand the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could\\nspare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we\\nmight have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;\\nfor want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think\\nthemselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into\\nanother.  You know,  says he,  the children of Israel, though they\\nrejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled\\neven against God Himself, that delivered them, when they came to want\\nbread in the wilderness. \\n\\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\\nwith his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as\\nthe wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a\\nmonth s time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much\\nland cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley\\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had\\nto spare: indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food\\nfor the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say\\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not\\nto be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\\n\\nHaving now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us\\nout of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had\\nbeen very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\\noccasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it\\nwas impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.\\nFor this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for\\nour work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I\\ncaused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to\\noversee and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable\\npains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to\\ndo the like, till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak,\\nnear two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four\\ninches thick: what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.\\n\\nAt the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats\\nas much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard\\ngo out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our\\nturns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up\\nwith the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and\\nadded them to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the\\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in\\nthe sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of\\nthe sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and\\nthese, with our bread, formed a great part of our food very good living\\ntoo, I assure you, for they are exceedingly nourishing.\\n\\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most\\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was\\nenough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we\\nbrought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and\\nthe like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food\\nto the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore\\nwith me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very\\nplentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of\\nthe world; that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed\\nand secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more\\nwicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard\\nwas very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I\\ndid not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no\\nneed of it.\\n\\nAnd now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\\nwith those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not\\nto bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself\\nand the old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or\\nattack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to\\nsend for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand\\nby him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went\\nwould be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this\\nshould be put in writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to\\nhave done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a\\nquestion which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard\\nand the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the\\ncanoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought\\nin, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave\\neach of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges\\nof powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and\\nnot to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.\\n\\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view\\nof my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them\\nprovisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for\\nmany days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days \\ntime; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them\\nabout a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should\\nknow them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on\\nshore. They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at\\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it\\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\\nsure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my\\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\\n\\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange\\nand unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps,\\nbeen heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,\\nwhen my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud,  Master,\\nmaster, they are come, they are come!  I jumped up, and regardless of\\ndanger I went, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little\\ngrove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick\\nwood; I say, regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not\\nmy custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea,\\nI presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing\\nin for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and\\nthe wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed,\\npresently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay\\non, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called\\nFriday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we\\nlooked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or\\nenemies. In the next place I went in to fetch my perspective glass to\\nsee what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I\\nclimbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was\\napprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer without being\\ndiscovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my eye plainly\\ndiscovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half\\ndistance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the\\nshore. By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and\\nthe boat appeared to be an English long-boat.\\n\\nI cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a\\nship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own\\ncountrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;\\nbut yet I had some secret doubts hung about me I cannot tell from\\nwhence they came bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it\\noccurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in\\nthat part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of\\nthe world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been\\nno storms to drive them in there in distress; and that if they were\\nreally English it was most probable that they were here upon no good\\ndesign; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the\\nhands of thieves and murderers.\\n\\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which\\nsometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of\\nits being real. That such hints and notices are given us I believe few\\nthat have made any observation of things can deny; that they are\\ncertain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits,\\nwe cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of\\ndanger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent\\n(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question),\\nand that they are given for our good?\\n\\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\\ncome it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far\\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept\\nmyself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as\\nif they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of\\nlanding; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not\\nsee the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their\\nboat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was\\nvery happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my\\ndoor, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and\\nperhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore I was\\nfully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two\\nI thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven\\nmen, whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought,\\nbound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,\\nthey took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I\\ncould perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,\\naffliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two,\\nI could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared\\nconcerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was\\nperfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it\\nshould be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could,  O\\nmaster! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans. \\n Why, Friday,  says I,  do you think they are going to eat them, then? \\n Yes,  says Friday,  they will eat them.   No no,  says I,  Friday; I\\nam afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure they will\\nnot eat them. \\n\\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but\\nstood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment\\nwhen the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the\\nvillains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it,\\nor sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall\\nevery moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in\\nmy veins. I wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that\\nhad gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered\\nwithin shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, for I saw\\nno firearms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another\\nway. After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the\\ninsolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the\\nisland, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three\\nother men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down\\nall three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in\\ndespair. This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore,\\nand began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly\\nI looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged\\nin the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I\\nknew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the\\nprovidential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and\\ntide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported; so\\nthese three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance\\nand supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and\\nreally they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they\\nthought themselves lost and their case desperate. So little do we see\\nbefore us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully\\nupon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures\\nso absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have\\nalways something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer\\ndeliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their\\ndeliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their\\ndestruction.\\n\\nIt was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while\\nthey rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had\\ncarelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed\\nconsiderably away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in\\nthe boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much\\nbrandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than\\nthe other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it,\\nhallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they\\nall soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch\\nher, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft\\noozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true\\nseamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to\\nforethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the\\ncountry again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling\\nthem off from the boat,  Why, let her alone, Jack, can t you? she ll\\nfloat next tide;  by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of\\nwhat countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not\\nonce daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place of\\nobservation near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to think how\\nwell it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the\\nboat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might\\nbe at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse,\\nif they had any. In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle as\\nbefore, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind\\nof enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an\\nexcellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took\\nmyself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure,\\nindeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with\\nthe great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols\\nin my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\\n\\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it\\nwas dark; but about two o clock, being the heat of the day, I found\\nthat they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought,\\nlaid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for\\ntheir condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the\\nshelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as\\nI thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to\\ndiscover myself to them, and learn something of their condition;\\nimmediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind\\nme, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a\\nspectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I\\ncould, and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in\\nSpanish,  What are ye, gentlemen?  They started up at the noise, but\\nwere ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure\\nthat I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them\\njust going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.\\n Gentlemen,  said I,  do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have a\\nfriend near when you did not expect it.   He must be sent directly from\\nheaven then,  said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his\\nhat at the same time to me;  for our condition is past the help of\\nman.   All help is from heaven, sir,  said I,  but can you put a\\nstranger in the way to help you? for you seem to be in some great\\ndistress. I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make\\napplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up\\nhis sword to kill you. \\n\\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\\nlike one astonished, returned,  Am I talking to God or man? Is it a\\nreal man or an angel?   Be in no fear about that, sir,  said I;  if God\\nhad sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed,\\nand armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your\\nfears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I\\nhave one servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can\\nwe serve you? What is your case?   Our case, sir,  said he,  is too\\nlong to tell you while our murderers are so near us; but, in short,\\nsir, I was commander of that ship my men have mutinied against me; they\\nhave been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set\\nme on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me one my\\nmate, the other a passenger where we expected to perish, believing the\\nplace to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.   Where\\nare these brutes, your enemies?  said I;  do you know where they are\\ngone?   There they lie, sir,  said he, pointing to a thicket of trees;\\n my heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if\\nthey have, they will certainly murder us all.   Have they any\\nfirearms?  said I. He answered,  They had only two pieces, one of which\\nthey left in the boat.   Well, then,  said I,  leave the rest to me; I\\nsee they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but\\nshall we rather take them prisoners?  He told me there were two\\ndesperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy\\nto; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to\\ntheir duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at\\nthat distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything\\nI would direct.  Well,  says I,  let us retreat out of their view or\\nhearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.  So they\\nwillingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.\\n\\n Look you, sir,  said I,  if I venture upon your deliverance, are you\\nwilling to make two conditions with me?  He anticipated my proposals by\\ntelling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly\\ndirected and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not\\nrecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world\\nsoever I would send him; and the two other men said the same.  Well, \\nsays I,  my conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this\\nisland with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I\\nput arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to\\nme, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the\\nmeantime be governed by my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may\\nbe recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free. \\n\\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could\\ndevise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and\\nbesides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions\\nas long as he lived.  Well, then,  said I,  here are three muskets for\\nyou, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be\\ndone.  He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,\\nbut offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was very\\nhard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to\\nfire on them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the\\nfirst volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it\\nwholly upon God s providence to direct the shot. He said, very\\nmodestly, that he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that\\nthose two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all\\nthe mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still,\\nfor they would go on board and bring the whole ship s company, and\\ndestroy us all.  Well, then,  says I,  necessity legitimates my advice,\\nfor it is the only way to save our lives.  However, seeing him still\\ncautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and\\nmanage as they found convenient.\\n\\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\\nafter we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them\\nwere the heads of the mutiny? He said,  No.   Well, then,  said I,  you\\nmay let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on\\npurpose to save themselves. Now,  says I,  if the rest escape you, it\\nis your fault.  Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him\\nin his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him,\\nwith each a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going\\nfirst made some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned\\nabout, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late\\nthen, for the moment he cried out they fired I mean the two men, the\\ncaptain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their\\nshot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and\\nthe other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his\\nfeet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain\\nstepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should\\ncall upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him\\ndown with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there\\nwere three more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded.\\nBy this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it\\nwas in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them he\\nwould spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their\\nabhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to\\nbe faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying\\nher back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the\\nprotestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was\\nwilling to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not\\nagainst, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while\\nthey were on the island.\\n\\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain s mate to the boat\\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which\\nthey did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for\\nthem) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and\\nseeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror,\\nthey submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\\n\\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one\\nanother s circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,\\nwhich he heard with an attention even to amazement and particularly at\\nthe wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and\\nammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,\\nit affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself,\\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his\\nlife, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.\\nAfter this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men\\ninto my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the\\ntop of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,\\nand showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long\\ninhabiting that place.\\n\\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above\\nall, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now\\nplanted nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in\\nEngland, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in\\nany part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little\\nwinding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my\\nresidence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,\\nwhither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too\\nanother time; but at present our business was to consider how to\\nrecover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was\\nperfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still\\nsix-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed\\nconspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,\\nwould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,\\nknowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows\\nas soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and\\nthat, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a\\nnumber as we were.\\n\\nI mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very\\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on\\nspeedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\\nsurprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon\\nthis, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship s\\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat,\\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and\\nthat then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:\\nthis he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing\\nwe had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that\\nthey might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave\\nher so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly, we went on\\nboard, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever\\nelse we found there which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a\\nfew biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a\\npiece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very\\nwelcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none\\nleft for many years.\\n\\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail,\\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great\\nhole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us,\\nyet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my\\nthoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,\\nthat if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to\\nmake her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon\\nour friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my\\nthoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE SHIP RECOVERED\\n\\n\\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would\\nnot float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in\\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what\\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her\\nensign as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stirred;\\nand they fired several times, making other signals for the boat. At\\nlast, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they\\nfound the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses,\\nhoist another boat out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they\\napproached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they\\nhad firearms with them.\\n\\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view\\nof them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because\\nthe tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they\\nrowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had\\nlanded, and where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full\\nview of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all\\nthe men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest\\nfellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,\\nbeing over-powered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who\\nit seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were\\nas outrageous as any of the ship s crew, and were no doubt made\\ndesperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was\\nthat they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him\\nthat men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that\\nseeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which\\nwe were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,\\nwhether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him\\nwhat he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a\\ndeliverance were not worth venturing for?  And where, sir,  said I,  is\\nyour belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,\\nwhich elevated you a little while ago? For my part,  said I,  there\\nseems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.   What is\\nthat?  say he.  Why,  said I,  it is, that as you say there are three\\nor four honest fellows among them which should be spared, had they been\\nall of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God s\\nprovidence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for\\ndepend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die\\nor live as they behave to us.  As I spoke this with a raised voice and\\ncheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set\\nvigorously to our business.\\n\\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat s coming from the ship,\\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured\\nthem effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured\\nthan ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men,\\nto my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being\\nheard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they\\ncould have delivered themselves. Here they left them bound, but gave\\nthem provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to\\ngive them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted\\ntheir escape they should be put to death without mercy. They promised\\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over\\nthem at the entrance.\\n\\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\\nindeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other\\ntwo were taken into my service, upon the captain s recommendation, and\\nupon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and\\nthe three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt\\nwe should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest\\nmen among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other\\nboat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore,\\nhauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was\\nafraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance\\nfrom the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should\\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they\\ndid, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were\\nunder a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was\\nin her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while\\nupon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all\\ntheir might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all\\nwas to no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a\\nvolley of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made\\nthe woods ring. But it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure,\\ncould not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well\\nenough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at\\nthe surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved\\nto go all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men\\nwere all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they\\nimmediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.\\n\\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this,\\nbelieving they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving\\ntheir comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,\\nwhich he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as\\nmuch frightened the other way.\\n\\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them\\nall coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,\\nwhich it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in\\nthe boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to\\nlook for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now\\nwe were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore\\nwould be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they\\nwould row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to\\nweigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.\\nHowever we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things\\nmight present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained\\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to\\nan anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at\\nthem in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,\\nmarching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation\\nlay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.\\nWe should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so\\nthat we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther\\noff, that we might come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of\\nthe hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods,\\nwhich lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest,\\nthey shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it\\nseems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they\\nsat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit to\\nhave gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had\\ndone the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger\\nto venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger\\nwas they had to fear.\\n\\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\\nthem just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.\\nI liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough\\nto come up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this\\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute\\nwhat course to take. At length I told them there would be nothing done,\\nin my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the\\nboat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore,\\nand so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on\\nshore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their\\nremoving; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw\\nthem all start up and march down towards the sea; it seems they had\\nsuch dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they\\nresolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for\\nlost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\\n\\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be\\nas it really was that they had given over their search, and were going\\nback again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was\\nready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a\\nstratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a\\ntittle. I ordered Friday and the captain s mate to go over the little\\ncreek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when\\nFriday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round,\\nat about half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they\\ncould, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as\\never they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again;\\nand then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the\\nothers hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the\\nwoods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I\\ndirected them.\\n\\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed;\\nand they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore\\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the\\ncreek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called\\nfor the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When\\nthey had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a\\ngood way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land,\\nthey took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and\\nleft only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little\\ntree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving\\nFriday and the captain s mate to their business, I took the rest with\\nme; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two\\nmen before they were aware one of them lying on the shore, and the\\nother being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and\\nwaking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in\\nupon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat\\nto yield, or he was a dead man. They needed very few arguments to\\npersuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his\\ncomrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who\\nwere not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore\\nwas easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very\\nsincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain s mate so\\nwell managed their business with the rest that they drew them, by\\nhallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to\\nanother, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where\\nthey were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it\\nwas dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the\\ntime they came back to us.\\n\\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours\\nafter Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and\\nwe could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up,\\ncalling to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer,\\nand complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any\\nfaster: which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to\\nthe boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion when they\\nfound the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their\\ntwo men gone. We could hear them call one to another in a most\\nlamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted\\nisland; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all\\nbe murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they\\nshould be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and\\ncalled their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no\\nanswer. After some time we could see them, by the little light there\\nwas, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes\\nthey would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come\\nashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.\\nMy men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once\\nin the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to\\nspare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was\\nunwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others\\nwere very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not\\nseparate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade\\nnearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands\\nand feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be\\ndiscovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they\\noffered to fire.\\n\\nThey had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the\\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them,\\nwith two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this\\nprincipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have\\npatience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only\\nheard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and\\nFriday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was\\nkilled upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and fell just\\nby him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third\\nran for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my\\nwhole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo;\\nFriday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the\\nthree prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon\\nthem, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I\\nmade the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call\\nthem by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps\\nmight reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for\\nindeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be\\nvery willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one\\nof them,  Tom Smith! Tom Smith!  Tom Smith answered immediately,  Is\\nthat Robinson?  for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered,\\n Ay, ay; for God s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or\\nyou are all dead men this moment.   Who must we yield to? Where are\\nthey?  says Smith again.  Here they are,  says he;  here s our captain\\nand fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours; the\\nboatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if\\nyou do not yield you are all lost.   Will they give us quarter, then? \\nsays Tom Smith,  and we will yield.   I ll go and ask, if you promise\\nto yield,  said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain\\nhimself then calls out,  You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down\\nyour arms immediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but\\nWill Atkins. \\n\\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out,  For God s sake, captain, give me\\nquarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I:  which, by\\nthe way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man\\nthat laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him\\nbarbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.\\nHowever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,\\nand trust to the governor s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all\\ncalled me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged\\ntheir lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two\\nmore, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,\\nwith those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,\\nand upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight\\nfor reasons of state.\\n\\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship:\\nand as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him,\\nand upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it\\nmust bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the\\ngallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their\\nlives. As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the\\ncommander s of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore\\nin a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct\\nthem that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman;\\nthat he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given\\nthem all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be\\ndealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\\nwould be hanged in the morning.\\n\\nThough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\\neffect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with\\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God s\\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\\n\\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and\\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\\ncalled the captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the\\nmen was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain,  Captain, the\\ncommander calls for you;  and presently the captain replied,  Tell his\\nexcellency I am just coming.  This more perfectly amazed them, and they\\nall believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men. Upon\\nthe captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship,\\nwhich he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution\\nthe next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be\\nsecure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he\\nshould go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send\\nthem pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was committed to\\nFriday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They\\nconveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal\\nplace, especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my\\nbower, as I called it, of which I have given a full description: and as\\nit was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,\\nconsidering they were upon their behaviour.\\n\\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he\\nthought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the\\nship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they\\nwere brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter\\nfor their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to\\nEngland they would all be hanged in chains; but that if they would join\\nin so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the\\ngovernor s engagement for their pardon.\\n\\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men\\nin their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and\\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and\\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a\\nfather to them as long as they lived.  Well,  says the captain,  I must\\ngo and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring\\nhim to consent to it.  So he brought me an account of the temper he\\nfound them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.\\nHowever, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back\\nagain and choose out those five, and tell them, that they might see he\\ndid not want men, that he would take out those five to be his\\nassistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and the\\nthree that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for\\nthe fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the\\nexecution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the\\nshore. This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in\\nearnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it\\nwas now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to\\npersuade the other five to do their duty.\\n\\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the\\ncaptain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the\\nfirst gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had\\ngiven their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third, the other two\\nthat I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain s\\nmotion had now released; fourth, these five released at last; so that\\nthere were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave\\nfor hostages.\\n\\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\\nboard the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries;\\nand I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\\nFriday was to take them.\\n\\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;\\nand that it was the governor s pleasure they should not stir anywhere\\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the\\ncastle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see\\nme as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\\n\\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well,\\nfor they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came\\nwithin call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they\\nhad brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time\\nbefore they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till\\nthey came to the ship s side; when the captain and the mate entering\\nfirst with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and\\ncarpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully\\nseconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the\\nmain and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them\\ndown that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering at\\nthe forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle\\nwhich went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there\\nprisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain\\nordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where\\nthe new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and\\nwith two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when the\\nmate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men\\nfired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which\\nbroke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The\\nmate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded\\nas he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the head,\\nthe bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his\\nears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,\\nand the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.\\n\\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\\nhis success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having\\nsat watching upon the shore for it till near two o clock in the\\nmorning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it\\nhaving been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I\\nwas surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I\\nheard a man call me by the name of  Governor! Governor!  and presently\\nI knew the captain s voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill,\\nthere he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms,\\n My dear friend and deliverer,  says he,  there s your ship; for she is\\nall yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.  I cast my eyes\\nto the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of\\nthe shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters\\nof her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just\\nagainst the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the\\ncaptain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first\\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to\\nsink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly\\nput into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to\\ncarry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was\\nnot able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I\\nheld fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived\\nthe surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and\\ngave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.\\nAfter I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought\\nme to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to\\nhim. All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only\\nnot under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender\\nthings to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood\\nof joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last\\nit broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my\\nspeech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we\\nrejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven\\nto deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\\neye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the\\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not\\nto lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could\\nforbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided\\nfor me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from\\nwhom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.\\n\\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this,\\nhe called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore\\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\\nbeen one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had\\nbeen to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of\\nbottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira\\nwine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good\\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship s beef, and six pieces of pork,\\nwith a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also\\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and\\ntwo bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But besides\\nthese, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me\\nsix new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one\\npair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit\\nof clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word,\\nhe clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable\\npresent, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never\\nwas anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and\\nuneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.\\n\\nAfter these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were\\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be\\ndone with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we\\nmight venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom\\nhe knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the\\ncaptain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging\\nthem, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as\\nmalefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English\\ncolony he could come to; and I found that the captain himself was very\\nanxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would\\nundertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request\\nthat he should leave them upon the island.  I should be very glad of\\nthat,  says the captain,  with all my heart.   Well,  says I,  I will\\nsend for them up and talk with them for you.  So I caused Friday and\\nthe two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having\\nperformed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and\\nbring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep\\nthem there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my\\nnew habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the\\ncaptain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told\\nthem I had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to the\\ncaptain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to\\ncommit further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in\\ntheir own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had\\ndug for others. I let them know that by my direction the ship had been\\nseized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that\\ntheir new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that\\nthey would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted\\nto know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates\\ntaken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had\\nauthority so to do.\\n\\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\\nsay but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their\\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not\\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to\\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England\\nother than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running\\naway with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know,\\nwould be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them,\\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they\\ndesired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some\\ninclination to give them their lives, if they thought they could shift\\non shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much\\nrather venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged.\\nSo I left it on that issue.\\n\\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he\\ndurst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\\nseeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my\\nword; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set\\nthem at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might\\ntake them again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very\\nthankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire\\ninto the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them\\nsome firearms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should\\nlive very well if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board\\nthe ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my\\nthings, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all\\nright in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering\\nhim, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be\\nhanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.\\n\\nWhen the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.\\nI told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\\nhad carried them away they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the\\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\\nnothing less to expect.\\n\\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them\\nI would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into\\nthe way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole\\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I\\ntold them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be\\nexpected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them\\nin common with themselves. Here it may be noted that the captain, who\\nhad ink on board, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of\\nmaking ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done\\nthings much more difficult.\\n\\nI left them my firearms viz. five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and\\nthree swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after\\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a\\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them\\nevery part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the\\ncaptain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some\\ngarden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of. Also, I\\ngave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and\\nbade them be sure to sow and increase them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. RETURN TO ENGLAND\\n\\n\\nHaving done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the\\nship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.\\nThe next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship s\\nside, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three,\\nbegged to be taken into the ship for God s sake, for they should be\\nmurdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though he\\nhanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pretended to have no\\npower without me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn\\npromises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time\\nafter, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest\\nand quiet fellows.\\n\\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling\\nthem that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I\\nwould not forget them.\\n\\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the\\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots;\\nalso, I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had\\nlain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and\\ncould hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and\\nhandled, as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.\\nAnd thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the\\nship s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it\\neight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered\\nfrom this second captivity the same day of the month that I first made\\nmy escape in the long-boat from among the Moors of Sallee. In this\\nvessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in\\nthe year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.\\n\\nWhen I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as\\nif I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward,\\nwhom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great\\nmisfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very\\nlow in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring\\nher I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for\\nher former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little\\nstock would afford; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do\\nbut little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former\\nkindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her,\\nas shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterwards into\\nYorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family\\nextinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of\\none of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,\\nthere had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found\\nnothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would\\nnot do much for me as to settling in the world.\\n\\nI met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and\\nthis was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,\\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives\\nof the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other\\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome\\ncompliment upon the subject, and a present of almost  200 sterling.\\n\\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some\\ninformation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what\\nwas become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years\\npast given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,\\nwhere I arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very\\nhonestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant\\nupon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and\\nto my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship\\nwho first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown\\nold, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far\\nfrom a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.\\nThe old man did not know me, and indeed I hardly knew him. But I soon\\nbrought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his\\nremembrance, when I told him who I was.\\n\\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old\\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but\\nthat he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living,\\nbut the trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my\\npart were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very\\ngood account of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the\\ngeneral belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given\\nin the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the\\nprocurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to\\nclaim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St.\\nAugustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the\\nconversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I\\nappeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be\\nrestored; only that the improvement, or annual production, being\\ndistributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured\\nme that the steward of the king s revenue from lands, and the\\nprovidore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along\\nthat the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a\\nfaithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my\\nmoiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had\\nbrought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth\\nlooking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any\\nobstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he\\ncould not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but\\nthis he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the\\nenjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he\\nhad heard that the king s third of my part, which was, it seems,\\ngranted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to\\nabove two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a\\nquiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my\\npartner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also\\nenrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the\\nsurvivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very\\nwealthy; and he believed I would not only have their assistance for\\nputting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of\\nmoney in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm\\nwhile their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as\\nabove; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\\n\\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees\\nshould thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my\\nwill, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\\n\\nHe told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\\ndead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should\\ncome of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with\\na thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put\\nin his claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or\\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the\\ningenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was\\nnow at the Brazils, orders to do it.  But,  says the old man,  I have\\none piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable\\nto you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the\\nworld believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account\\nwith me, in your name, for the first six or eight years  profits, which\\nI received. There being at that time great disbursements for increasing\\nthe works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to\\nnear so much as afterwards it produced; however,  says the old man,  I\\nshall give you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I\\nhave disposed of it. \\n\\nAfter a few days  further conference with this ancient friend, he\\nbrought me an account of the first six years  income of my plantation,\\nsigned by my partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered\\nin goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum,\\nmolasses, &c., which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by\\nthis account, that every year the income considerably increased; but,\\nas above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small:\\nhowever, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred\\nand seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen\\ndouble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been\\nshipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having\\nthe place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and\\nhow he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses,\\nand buy him a share in a new ship.  However, my old friend,  says he,\\n you shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son\\nreturns you shall be fully satisfied.  Upon this he pulls out an old\\npouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold;\\nand giving the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was\\ngone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter-part owner, and his son\\nanother, he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.\\n\\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to\\nbe able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he\\nhad taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all\\noccasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I\\ncould hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I\\nasked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at\\nthat time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could not\\nsay but it might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money,\\nand I might want it more than he.\\n\\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\\nthe plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I\\nafterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his\\nson s ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the\\nmoney, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but\\ncame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a\\npenny more from him.\\n\\nWhen this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a\\nmethod to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought to go\\nover to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I\\ndid not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in\\na public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\\nplanting the said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by\\na notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a\\nletter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;\\nand then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the\\nreturn.\\n\\nNever was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this\\nprocuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet\\nfrom the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I\\nwent to sea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers\\nenclosed: \\n\\nFirst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or\\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old\\nPortugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one\\nthousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.\\n\\nSecondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the\\neffects in their hands, before the government claimed the\\nadministration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which\\nthey called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the\\nplantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and\\nforty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and forty\\nmoidores.\\n\\nThirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine s account, who had\\nreceived the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to\\naccount for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly\\ndeclared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed,\\nwhich he acknowledged to my account: as to the king s part, that\\nrefunded nothing.\\n\\nThere was a letter of my partner s, congratulating me very\\naffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate\\nwas improved, and what it produced a year; with the particulars of the\\nnumber of squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many\\nslaves there were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for\\nblessings, told me he had said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the\\nBlessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come\\nover and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him\\norders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself;\\nconcluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his\\nfamily; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards  skins, which he\\nhad, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had\\nsent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He\\nsent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces\\nof gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my\\ntwo merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of\\nsugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole\\naccount in gold.\\n\\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better\\nthan the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my\\nvery heart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships\\ncome all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my\\ngoods: and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came\\nto my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the\\nold man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of\\njoy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I\\ncontinued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent\\nfor, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he\\nordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well:\\nbut I verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that\\nmanner to the spirits, I should have died.\\n\\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds\\nsterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the\\nBrazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of\\nlands in England: and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce\\nknew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of\\nit. The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my\\ngood old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress,\\nkind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him\\nall that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of\\nHeaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now\\nlay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first\\nreturned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent\\nfor a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge\\nfrom the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged\\nhe owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which I\\ncaused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of\\nthe annual profits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to\\naccount with him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in\\nmy name; and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred\\nmoidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty\\nmoidores a year to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited\\nmy old man.\\n\\nI had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do\\nwith the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and,\\nindeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life\\nin the island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing\\nbut what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my\\nbusiness was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide my money\\nin, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew\\nmouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the\\ncontrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old\\npatron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I\\nhad. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me\\nthither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I\\nhad settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind\\nme. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was\\nhonest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but\\npoor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I\\nhad no way but to go back to England myself and take my effects with\\nme.\\n\\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and,\\ntherefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his\\nsatisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of\\nthe poor widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she,\\nwhile it was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So, the\\nfirst thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his\\ncorrespondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her\\nout, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk\\nwith her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if\\nI lived, have a further supply: at the same time I sent my two sisters\\nin the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want,\\nyet not in very good circumstances; one having been married and left a\\nwidow; and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should\\nbe. But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch\\nupon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go\\naway to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly\\nperplexed me.\\n\\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself\\nthere, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some\\nlittle scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me\\nback. However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for\\nthe present; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the\\nreligion of the country all the while I was among them, so neither did\\nI yet; only that, now and then, having of late thought more of it than\\nformerly, when I began to think of living and dying among them, I began\\nto regret having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be\\nthe best religion to die with.\\n\\nBut, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from\\ngoing to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave\\nmy effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if\\nI arrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find\\nsome relations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I\\nprepared to go to England with all my wealth.\\n\\nIn order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet\\nbeing just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just\\nand faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the\\nPrior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just\\ndealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores\\nwhich were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred\\nto the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the\\nprior should direct; desiring the good padre s prayers for me, and the\\nlike. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the\\nacknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for\\nsending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of\\nit. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the\\nimproving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of\\nthe works; giving him instructions for his future government of my\\npart, according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I\\ndesired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from\\nme more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to\\ncome to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.\\nTo this I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his\\nwife and two daughters, for such the captain s son informed me he had;\\nwith two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in\\nLisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good\\nvalue.\\n\\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my\\neffects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way\\nto go to England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I\\nhad a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and\\nyet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me\\nso much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet\\nI altered my mind, and that not once but two or three times.\\n\\nIt is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of\\nthe reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own\\nthoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled\\nout to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other,\\nhaving put my things on board one of them, and in the other having\\nagreed with the captain; I say two of these ships miscarried. One was\\ntaken by the Algerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near\\nTorbay, and all the people drowned except three; so that in either of\\nthose vessels I had been made miserable.\\n\\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I\\ncommunicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but\\neither to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to\\nRochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to\\nParis, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all\\nthe way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed\\nagainst my going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I\\nresolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste,\\nand did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to\\nmake it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son\\nof a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which\\nwe picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese\\ngentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that in all there were six\\nof us and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese,\\ncontenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge;\\nand as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,\\nbesides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of\\nsupplying the place of a servant on the road.\\n\\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well\\nmounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the\\nhonour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as\\nbecause I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole\\njourney.\\n\\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble\\nyou now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that\\nhappened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.\\n\\nWhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were\\nwilling to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth\\nobserving; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened\\naway, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we\\ncame to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the\\nway, with an account that so much snow was falling on the French side\\nof the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to\\nPampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.\\n\\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me,\\nthat had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I\\ncould scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor,\\nindeed, was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before\\nout of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot,\\nand immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very\\nkeen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing\\nand perishing of our fingers and toes.\\n\\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered\\nwith snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt\\nbefore in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it\\ncontinued snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people\\nsaid winter was come before its time; and the roads, which were\\ndifficult before, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow\\nlay in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard\\nfrozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no going\\nwithout being in danger of being buried alive every step. We stayed no\\nless than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,\\nand no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter\\nall over Europe that had been known in the memory of man) I proposed\\nthat we should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for\\nBordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering\\nthis, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on\\nthe French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out\\na guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had\\nbrought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much\\nincommoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity,\\nthey said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We\\nsent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the\\nsame way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed\\nsufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in\\nthese great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at\\nthe foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the\\nground being covered with snow. We told him we were well enough\\nprepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a\\nkind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger\\nfrom, especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied us\\nthat there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go; so\\nwe readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen\\nwith their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had\\nattempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.\\n\\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of\\nNovember; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he\\ncame directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,\\nabout twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the\\nplain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the\\ncountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning\\nto his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is\\ntrue the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many\\ntours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we\\ninsensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much\\nencumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant\\nand fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and\\nflourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way to\\npass still.\\n\\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day\\nand a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we\\nshould soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend\\nevery day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon\\nour guide, we went on.\\n\\nIt was about two hours before night when, our guide being something\\nbefore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves,\\nand after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two\\nof the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he\\nwould have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them\\nfastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such\\nviolence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his\\npistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday\\nbeing next me, I bade him ride up and see what was the matter. As soon\\nas Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the\\nother,  O master! O master!  but like a bold fellow, rode directly up\\nto the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that\\nattacked him.\\n\\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having\\nbeen used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him,\\nbut went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would\\nhave fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the\\nwolf or endangered shooting the man.\\n\\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed,\\nit alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday s pistol, we\\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few\\nas that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed\\nthis wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him\\nimmediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily\\nfastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his\\nteeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him\\ntwice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and\\nthough he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the\\ndisorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.\\n\\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday s pistol we all\\nmended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very\\ndifficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as\\nwe came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly\\nwhat had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide,\\nthough we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had\\nkilled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR\\n\\n\\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising\\nmanner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave\\nus all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the\\ngreatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,\\nand does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has\\ntwo particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions;\\nfirst, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually\\nattempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively\\nhungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being\\ncovered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle\\nwith you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give\\nhim the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step\\nout of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best\\nway is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you\\nstop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an\\naffront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a\\nbit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets\\nall other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have\\nsatisfaction in point of honour that is his first quality: the next is,\\nif he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he\\nhas his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes\\nyou.\\n\\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he\\nwas helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and\\nfrightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood;\\nand a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were\\nall a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was\\neasy to see joy and courage in the fellow s countenance.  O! O! O! \\nsays Friday, three times, pointing to him;  O master, you give me te\\nleave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh. \\n\\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased.  You fool,  says I,\\n he will eat you up. Eatee me up! eatee me up!  says Friday, twice\\nover again;  me eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay\\nhere, me show you good laugh.  So down he sits, and gets off his boots\\nin a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes\\nthey wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his\\nhorse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.\\n\\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till\\nFriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could\\nunderstand him.  Hark ye, hark ye,  says Friday,  me speakee with you. \\nWe followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of\\nthe mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was\\nplain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here\\nand there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up\\nwith him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and\\nhit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had\\nthrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday s end, for the rogue\\nwas so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,\\nand show us some laugh as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the\\nblow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long\\nstrides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a\\nhorse to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his course as\\nif he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon\\nthe bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing\\nthe bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another\\nway; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,\\nand then ran away; and I called out,  You dog! is this your making us\\nlaugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature. \\nHe heard me, and cried out,  No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you\\nget much laugh:  and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear s\\none, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great\\noak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling\\nhis pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the\\nground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The\\nbear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first\\nthing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up\\nhe scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous\\nheavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could\\nnot for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up\\nthe tree, we all rode near to him.\\n\\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of\\na large branch, and the bear got about half-way to him. As soon as the\\nbear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker,  Ha! \\nsays he to us,  now you see me teachee the bear dance:  so he began\\njumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but\\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get\\nback; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with\\nhim by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him\\nagain, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English,  What, you\\ncome no farther? pray you come farther;  so he left jumping and shaking\\nthe tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come\\na little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped\\nagain. We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and\\ncalled to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he\\ncried out earnestly,  Oh, pray! Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and\\nthen:  he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story,\\nFriday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had\\nlaughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do:\\nfor first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we\\nfound the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out\\nfar enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws\\nand feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and\\nwhat the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly:\\nfor seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be\\npersuaded to come any farther,  Well, well,  says Friday,  you no come\\nfarther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;  and upon this he\\nwent out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and\\ngently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near\\nenough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it\\nup, and stood still.  Well,  said I to him,  Friday, what will you do\\nnow? Why don t you shoot him?   No shoot,  says Friday,  no yet; me\\nshoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:  and, indeed,\\nso he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the\\nbough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him\\nevery step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree,\\nthen, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,\\ngrasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very\\nleisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot\\non the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of\\nhis piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about\\nto see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our\\nlooks, he began to laugh very loud.  So we kill bear in my country, \\nsays Friday.  So you kill them?  says I;  why, you have no guns. No, \\nsays he,  no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.  This was a good\\ndiversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very\\nmuch hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran\\nmuch in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the\\nshore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard\\nanything that filled me with so much horror.\\n\\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as\\nFriday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of\\nthis monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near\\nthree leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and\\nwent forward on our journey.\\n\\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and\\ndangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard\\nafterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed\\nby hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in\\nthe villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great\\nmany of their sheep and horses, and some people too.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were\\nmore wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a\\nsmall plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow\\ndefile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and\\nthen we should come to the village where we were to lodge.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a\\nlittle after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with nothing in\\nthe first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which\\nwas not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the\\nroad, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of\\nsome prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone\\nout of sight in a few moments. Upon this, our guide, who, by the way,\\nwas but a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he\\nbelieved there were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and\\nour eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that\\nwood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as\\nwe came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The\\nfirst object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse\\nwhich the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we\\ncould not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had\\neaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at\\ntheir feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would have\\nlet fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found\\nwe were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware\\nof. We had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the\\nwolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and\\npresently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us,\\nall in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army\\ndrawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to\\nreceive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only\\nway; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much\\ninterval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the\\nothers, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second\\nvolley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that\\nthose that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees\\nagain, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed\\nwith a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this\\nmethod, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at\\npresent we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the\\nenemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with\\nthe fire. Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others\\nwere wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I\\nfound they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon,\\nremembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were\\nterrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as\\nloud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for\\nupon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I then ordered a\\nsecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop,\\nand away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our\\npieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had\\nbut little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness,\\nwhen we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that\\nit was farther onward, the same way we were to go.\\n\\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on\\na sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one\\nbehind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded\\nwith them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way\\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being\\nvery rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view\\nof the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the\\nfarther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming\\nnearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing\\njust at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we\\nheard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse,\\nwith a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or\\nseventeen wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of\\nthem; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we\\ndoubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but\\nthey did.\\n\\nBut here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and\\nof two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was\\nno doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just\\nby him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his\\nbody was eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what\\ncourse to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered\\nabout us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were\\nthree hundred of them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at\\nthe entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some\\nlarge timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I\\nsuppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those\\ntrees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised\\nthem all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,\\nto stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the\\ncentre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious\\ncharge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with\\na growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I\\nsaid, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey;\\nand this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their\\nseeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every\\nother man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of\\nthe wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a\\ncontinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on\\nthose before.\\n\\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they\\nstopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but\\na moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our\\npistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or\\neighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I\\nwas loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my\\nman Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest\\ndexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were\\nengaged but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of\\npowder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it\\nbe a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, when\\nthe wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an\\nuncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were\\nupon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell;\\nor rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we\\ndespatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with\\nthe light, which the night for it was now very near dark made more\\nterrible that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last\\npistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout;\\nupon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near\\ntwenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to\\ncutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the\\ncrying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so\\nthat they all fled and left us.\\n\\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it\\nbeen daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus\\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.\\nWe heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went\\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the\\nsnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more we\\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible\\nfright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and\\nsome bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror\\nthat they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in\\nthe night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.\\n\\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much\\nwith the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we\\nwere obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we\\nfound a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no\\nwolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse,\\nthey told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest\\nat the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the\\nground; but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would\\nventure to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it\\nwas surprising we were not all devoured. When we told them how we\\nplaced ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us\\nexceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all\\ndestroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so\\nfurious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really\\nafraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging on that\\naccount, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of\\ndanger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by\\nthe stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great\\nodds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content\\nto have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not\\nhave taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their\\nbacks, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we had\\nstood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to\\nhave devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having\\nour firearms in our hands, being so many in number. For my part, I was\\nnever so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred\\ndevils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing\\nto shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it\\nwas, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I\\nthink I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was\\nsure to meet with a storm once a-week.\\n\\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through\\nFrance nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with\\nmuch more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and\\nwithout any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover\\nthe 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel\\nin.\\n\\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time\\nall my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which\\nI brought with me having been currently paid.\\n\\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,\\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much\\nnor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that\\nI was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I\\nwas very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted\\nintegrity of this good gentlewoman.\\n\\nAnd now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it to the two\\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight\\nto a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.\\n\\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\\nexchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the\\nestate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him\\n(the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son\\nfor his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was\\nto make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part of\\na life of fortune and adventure a life of Providence s chequer-work,\\nand of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like\\nof; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of\\nit ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.\\n\\nAny one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I\\nwas past running any more hazards and so, indeed, I had been, if other\\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had\\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted\\nfresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet\\nI could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to\\nbe upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she\\nprevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews,\\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having\\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\\nsettlement of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I\\nplaced with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a\\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\\nand sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as\\nold as I was, to further adventures myself.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and\\nmy nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was\\nin the year 1694.\\n\\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\\nsubjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them a\\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\\naccidents as my own part particularly, also, as to their battles with\\nthe Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\\nimprovement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made\\nan attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and five\\nwomen prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\\nchildren on the island.\\n\\nHere I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary\\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\\nworkmen, which I had brought from England with me, viz. a carpenter and\\na smith.\\n\\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively\\nas they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged\\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.\\n\\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\\nI bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides\\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\\nI promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting which I\\nafterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and\\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart\\nfor them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\\nwere considerably increased.\\n\\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought\\nwith that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of\\nthem killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies  canoes,\\nthey famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and\\nrecovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the\\nisland.\\n\\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther\\naccount of in the Second Part of my Story.'}\n"

START IN LIFE\\n\\n\\nI was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\\nsettled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my\\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called nay we call\\nourselves and write our name Crusoe; and so my companions always called\\nme.\\n\\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\\nSpaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\\nmy father or mother knew what became of me.\\n\\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head\\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who\\nwas very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;\\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,\\nthe commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and\\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\\nsomething fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the\\nlife of misery which was to befall me.\\n\\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a\\nmere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father s house and my\\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\\nraising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\\npleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\\nof this state by this one thing viz. that this was the state of life\\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\\nriches.\\n\\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day s\\nexperience to know it more sensibly.\\n\\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\\nbe none to assist in my recovery.\\n\\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\\nhimself I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\\nfull he could say no more to me.\\n\\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\\nsettle at home according to my father s desire. But alas! a few days\\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father s further\\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\\nhim. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her\\na little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts\\nwere so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle\\nto anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\\ntrade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never\\nserve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master\\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did\\nnot like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double\\ndiligence, to recover the time that I had lost.\\n\\nThis put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would\\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\\nmuch for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\\nthing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and\\ntender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in\\nshort, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she\\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.\\n\\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard\\nafterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my\\nfather, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh,\\n That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes\\nabroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can\\ngive no consent to it. \\n\\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in\\nthe meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\\nto business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother\\nabout their being so positively determined against what they knew my\\ninclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went\\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;\\nbut, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail\\nto London in his father s ship, and prompting me to go with them with\\nthe common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing\\nfor my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so\\nmuch as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they\\nmight, without asking God s blessing or my father s, without any\\nconsideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God\\nknows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for\\nLondon. Never any young adventurer s misfortunes, I believe, began\\nsooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of\\nthe Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most\\nfrightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most\\ninexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously\\nto reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the\\njudgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father s house, and\\nabandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father s\\ntears and my mother s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my\\nconscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it\\nhas since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of\\nmy duty to God and my father.\\n\\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though\\nnothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a\\nfew days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a\\nyoung sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I expected\\nevery wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship\\nfell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we\\nshould never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and\\nresolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one\\nvoyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go\\ndirectly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I\\nlived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such\\nmiseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his\\nobservations about the middle station of life, how easy, how\\ncomfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to\\ntempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like\\na true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.\\n\\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted,\\nand indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and\\nthe sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was\\nvery grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but\\ntowards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a\\ncharming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and\\nrose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth\\nsea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most\\ndelightful that ever I saw.\\n\\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very\\ncheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and\\nterrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so\\nlittle a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue,\\nmy companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me;  Well, Bob,  says\\nhe, clapping me upon the shoulder,  how do you do after it? I warrant\\nyou were frighted, wer n t you, last night, when it blew but a capful\\nof wind?   A capful d you call it?  said I;  twas a terrible storm. \\n A storm, you fool you,  replies he;  do you call that a storm? why, it\\nwas nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think\\nnothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you re but a fresh-water\\nsailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we ll forget all\\nthat; d ye see what charming weather  tis now?  To make short this sad\\npart of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made\\nand I was made half drunk with it: and in that one night s wickedness I\\ndrowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all\\nmy resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to\\nits smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that\\nstorm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and\\napprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the\\ncurrent of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and\\npromises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of\\nreflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to\\nreturn again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from\\nthem as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and\\ncompany, soon mastered the return of those fits for so I called them;\\nand I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience\\nas any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could\\ndesire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence,\\nas in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely\\nwithout excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the\\nnext was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among\\nus would confess both the danger and the mercy of.\\n\\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\\nhaving been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way\\nsince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we\\nlay, the wind continuing contrary viz. at south-west for seven or eight\\ndays, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the\\nsame Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind\\nfor the river.\\n\\nWe had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up\\nthe river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four\\nor five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good\\nas a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,\\nour men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger,\\nbut spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but\\nthe eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all\\nhands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and\\nclose, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea\\nwent very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several\\nseas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which\\nour master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two\\nanchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.\\n\\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see\\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The\\nmaster, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as\\nhe went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to\\nhimself say, several times,  Lord be merciful to us! we shall be all\\nlost! we shall be all undone!  and the like. During these first hurries\\nI was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and\\ncannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which\\nI had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I\\nthought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be\\nnothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I\\nsaid just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully\\nfrighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal\\nsight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every\\nthree or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but\\ndistress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their\\nmasts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship\\nwhich rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships,\\nbeing driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at\\nall adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships\\nfared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three\\nof them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their\\nspritsail out before the wind.\\n\\nTowards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to\\nlet them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but\\nthe boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would\\nfounder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the\\nmain-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged\\nto cut that away also, and make a clear deck.\\n\\nAny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was\\nbut a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a\\nlittle. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about\\nme at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of\\nmy former convictions, and the having returned from them to the\\nresolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;\\nand these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a\\ncondition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not\\ncome yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves\\nacknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she\\nwas deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now\\nand then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one\\nrespect, that I did not know what they meant by _founder_ till I\\ninquired. However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not\\noften seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible\\nthan the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the\\nship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all\\nthe rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see\\ncried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water\\nin the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my\\nheart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side\\nof my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and\\ntold me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to\\npump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked\\nvery heartily. While this was doing the master, seeing some light\\ncolliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and\\nrun away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a\\nsignal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the\\nship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so\\nsurprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when\\neverybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was\\nbecome of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me\\naside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a\\ngreat while before I came to myself.\\n\\nWe worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent\\nthat the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a\\nlittle, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into\\nany port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light\\nship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help\\nus. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was\\nimpossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the\\nship s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing\\ntheir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with\\na buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after\\nmuch labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under\\nour stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them\\nor us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship;\\nso all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore\\nas much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was\\nstaved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly\\nrowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping\\ntowards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.\\n\\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we\\nsaw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant\\nby a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes\\nto look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment\\nthat they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go\\nin, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright,\\npartly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.\\n\\nWhile we were in this condition the men yet labouring at the oar to\\nbring the boat near the shore we could see (when, our boat mounting the\\nwaves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along\\nthe strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow\\nway towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being\\npast the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward\\ntowards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the\\nwind. Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all\\nsafe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as\\nunfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the\\nmagistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by\\nparticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us\\nsufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we thought\\nfit.\\n\\nHad I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home,\\nI had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour s parable,\\nhad even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went\\naway in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he\\nhad any assurances that I was not drowned.\\n\\nBut my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could\\nresist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my\\nmore composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know\\nnot what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling\\ndecree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own\\ndestruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with\\nour eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable\\nmisery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me\\nforward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired\\nthoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with\\nin my first attempt.\\n\\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the\\nmaster s son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to\\nme after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for\\nwe were separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first\\ntime he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very\\nmelancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling\\nhis father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,\\nin order to go further abroad, his father, turning to me with a very\\ngrave and concerned tone  Young man,  says he,  you ought never to go\\nto sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token\\nthat you are not to be a seafaring man.   Why, sir,  said I,  will you\\ngo to sea no more?   That is another case,  said he;  it is my calling,\\nand therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see\\nwhat a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you\\npersist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah\\nin the ship of Tarshish. Pray,  continues he,  what are you; and on\\nwhat account did you go to sea?  Upon that I told him some of my story;\\nat the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion:  What\\nhad I done,  says he,  that such an unhappy wretch should come into my\\nship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a\\nthousand pounds.  This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his\\nspirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was\\nfarther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards\\ntalked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and\\nnot tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand\\nof Heaven against me.  And, young man,  said he,  depend upon it, if\\nyou do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but\\ndisasters and disappointments, till your father s words are fulfilled\\nupon you. \\n\\nWe parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no\\nmore; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in my\\npocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the\\nroad, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take,\\nand whether I should go home or to sea.\\n\\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my\\nthoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at\\namong the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and\\nmother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often\\nobserved, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind\\nis, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in\\nsuch cases viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed\\nto repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be\\nesteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make\\nthem be esteemed wise men.\\n\\nIn this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what\\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible\\nreluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed away a while, the\\nremembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated,\\nthe little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till\\nat last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a\\nvoyage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. SLAVERY AND ESCAPE\\n\\n\\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my father s\\nhouse which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising\\nmy fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to\\nmake me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the\\ncommands of my father I say, the same influence, whatever it was,\\npresented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I\\nwent on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors\\nvulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea.\\n\\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship\\nmyself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little\\nharder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learnt the\\nduty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time might have qualified\\nmyself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was\\nalways my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money\\nin my pocket and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board\\nin the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the\\nship, nor learned to do any.\\n\\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,\\nwhich does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows\\nas I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for\\nthem very early; but it was not so with me. I first got acquainted with\\nthe master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who,\\nhaving had very good success there, was resolved to go again. This\\ncaptain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all\\ndisagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the\\nworld, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no\\nexpense; I should be his messmate and his companion; and if I could\\ncarry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the\\ntrade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.\\n\\nI embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this\\ncaptain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with\\nhim, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested\\nhonesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I\\ncarried about  40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me\\nto buy. These  40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of\\nmy relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my\\nfather, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my\\nfirst adventure.\\n\\nThis was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my\\nadventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the\\ncaptain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics\\nand the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the\\nship s course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some\\nthings that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took\\ndelight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this\\nvoyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five\\npounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in\\nLondon, at my return, almost  300; and this filled me with those\\naspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.\\n\\nYet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I\\nwas continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the\\nexcessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the\\ncoast, from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.\\n\\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great\\nmisfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same\\nvoyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his\\nmate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.\\nThis was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not\\ncarry quite  100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had  200 left,\\nwhich I had lodged with my friend s widow, who was very just to me, yet\\nI fell into terrible misfortunes. The first was this: our ship making\\nher course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands\\nand the African shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a\\nTurkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she\\ncould make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread,\\nor our masts carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon\\nus, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to\\nfight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About three\\nin the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just\\nathwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we\\nbrought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a\\nbroadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our\\nfire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men\\nwhich he had on board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men\\nkeeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend\\nourselves. But laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter,\\nhe entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting\\nand hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small shot,\\nhalf-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them\\ntwice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our\\nship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we\\nwere obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a\\nport belonging to the Moors.\\n\\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended;\\nnor was I carried up the country to the emperor s court, as the rest of\\nour men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper\\nprize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his\\nbusiness. At this surprising change of my circumstances, from a\\nmerchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I\\nlooked back upon my father s prophetic discourse to me, that I should\\nbe miserable and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so\\neffectually brought to pass that I could not be worse; for now the hand\\nof Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption; but,\\nalas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will\\nappear in the sequel of this story.\\n\\nAs my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was\\nin hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again,\\nbelieving that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a\\nSpanish or Portugal man-of-war; and that then I should be set at\\nliberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to\\nsea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the\\ncommon drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again\\nfrom his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the\\nship.\\n\\nHere I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to\\neffect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it;\\nnothing presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had\\nnobody to communicate it to that would embark with me no fellow-slave,\\nno Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two\\nyears, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never\\nhad the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.\\n\\nAfter about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put\\nthe old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.\\nMy patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,\\nwhich, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or\\ntwice a week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take the\\nship s pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always\\ntook me and young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very\\nmerry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that\\nsometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the\\nyouth the Maresco, as they called him to catch a dish of fish for him.\\n\\nIt happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog\\nrose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we\\nlost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we\\nlaboured all day, and all the next night; and when the morning came we\\nfound we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and\\nthat we were at least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well\\nin again, though with a great deal of labour and some danger; for the\\nwind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but we were all very\\nhungry.\\n\\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of\\nhimself for the future; and having lying by him the longboat of our\\nEnglish ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing\\nany more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the\\ncarpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little\\nstate-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a\\nbarge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the\\nmain-sheet; the room before for a hand or two to stand and work the\\nsails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the\\nboom jibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and\\nhad in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat\\non, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he\\nthought fit to drink; and his bread, rice, and coffee.\\n\\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most\\ndexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened\\nthat he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or\\nfor fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place,\\nand for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had, therefore, sent\\non board the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary;\\nand had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,\\nwhich were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of\\nfowling as well as fishing.\\n\\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning\\nwith the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and\\neverything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on\\nboard alone, and told me his guests had put off going from some\\nbusiness that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual,\\nto go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends\\nwere to sup at his house, and commanded that as soon as I got some fish\\nI should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to do.\\n\\nThis moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,\\nfor now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and\\nmy master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing\\nbusiness, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as\\nconsider, whither I should steer anywhere to get out of that place was\\nmy desire.\\n\\nMy first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to\\nget something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not\\npresume to eat of our patron s bread. He said that was true; so he\\nbrought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh\\nwater, into the boat. I knew where my patron s case of bottles stood,\\nwhich it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English\\nprize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore,\\nas if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a\\ngreat lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed about half a\\nhundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and\\na hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially\\nthe wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he\\ninnocently came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley,\\nor Moely; so I called to him Moely,  said I,  our patron s guns are on\\nboard the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we\\nmay kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I\\nknow he keeps the gunner s stores in the ship.   Yes,  says he,  I ll\\nbring some;  and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which\\nheld a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with\\nshot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into\\nthe boat. At the same time I had found some powder of my master s in\\nthe great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the\\ncase, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and\\nthus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to\\nfish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we\\nwere, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the\\nport before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish. The wind\\nblew from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown\\nsoutherly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least\\nreached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it\\nwould, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave\\nthe rest to fate.\\n\\nAfter we had fished some time and caught nothing for when I had fish on\\nmy hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them I said to\\nthe Moor,  This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we\\nmust stand farther off.  He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the\\nhead of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat\\nout near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish;\\nwhen, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,\\nand making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by\\nsurprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard\\ninto the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called\\nto me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world\\nwith me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me\\nvery quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into\\nthe cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at\\nhim, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I\\nwould do him none.  But,  said I,  you swim well enough to reach to the\\nshore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I\\nwill do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I ll shoot you\\nthrough the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty;  so he turned\\nhimself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he\\nreached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.\\n\\nI could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have\\ndrowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was\\ngone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him,\\n Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I ll make you a great man; but if\\nyou will not stroke your face to be true to me that is, swear by\\nMahomet and his father s beard I must throw you into the sea too.  The\\nboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could not\\ndistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world\\nwith me.\\n\\nWhile I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly\\nto sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might\\nthink me gone towards the Straits  mouth (as indeed any one that had\\nbeen in their wits must have been supposed to do): for who would have\\nsupposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian\\ncoast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with\\ntheir canoes and destroy us; where we could not go on shore but we\\nshould be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human\\nkind.\\n\\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and\\nsteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little towards\\nthe east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh\\ngale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe\\nby the next day, at three o clock in the afternoon, when I first made\\nthe land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of\\nSallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco s dominions, or indeed of\\nany other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.\\n\\nYet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful\\napprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,\\nor go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I\\nhad sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the\\nsouthward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of\\nme, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,\\nand came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what,\\nnor where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what\\nriver. I neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal\\nthing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,\\nresolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the\\ncountry; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful\\nnoises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we\\nknew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and\\nbegged of me not to go on shore till day.  Well, Xury,  said I,  then I\\nwon t; but it may be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to\\nus as those lions.   Then we give them the shoot gun,  says Xury,\\nlaughing,  make them run wey.  Such English Xury spoke by conversing\\namong us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I\\ngave him a dram (out of our patron s case of bottles) to cheer him up.\\nAfter all, Xury s advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little\\nanchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in\\ntwo or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to\\ncall them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the\\nwater, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling\\nthemselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I\\nnever indeed heard the like.\\n\\nXury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both\\nmore frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming\\ntowards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his\\nblowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a\\nlion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to\\nweigh the anchor and row away;  No,  says I,  Xury; we can slip our\\ncable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us\\nfar.  I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever\\nit was) within two oars  length, which something surprised me; however,\\nI immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at\\nhim; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore\\nagain.\\n\\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries\\nand howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as\\nhigher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing\\nI have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before:\\nthis convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night\\non that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another\\nquestion too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages\\nhad been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and\\ntigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.\\n\\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other\\nfor water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to\\nget to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with\\none of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some\\nto me. I asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in\\nthe boat? The boy answered with so much affection as made me love him\\never after. Says he,  If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey. \\n Well, Xury,  said I,  we will both go and if the wild mans come, we\\nwill kill them, they shall eat neither of us.  So I gave Xury a piece\\nof rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron s case of bottles\\nwhich I mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore\\nas we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but\\nour arms and two jars for water.\\n\\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of\\ncanoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place\\nabout a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by I saw him\\ncome running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or\\nfrighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help\\nhim; but when I came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his\\nshoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but\\ndifferent in colour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,\\nand it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with,\\nwas to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans.\\n\\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for\\na little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh\\nwhen the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled\\nour jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on\\nour way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of\\nthe country.\\n\\nAs I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that\\nthe islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay\\nnot far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an\\nobservation to know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing,\\nor at least remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where\\nto look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I\\nmight now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,\\nthat if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the\\nEnglish traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual\\ndesign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.\\n\\nBy the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that\\ncountry which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco s dominions and the\\nnegroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes\\nhaving abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and\\nthe Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness;\\nand indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of\\ntigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour\\nthere; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go\\nlike an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near\\na hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste,\\nuninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring\\nof wild beasts by night.\\n\\nOnce or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,\\nbeing the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a\\ngreat mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having\\ntried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also\\ngoing too high for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first\\ndesign, and keep along the shore.\\n\\nSeveral times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left\\nthis place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to\\nan anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the\\ntide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes\\nwere more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and\\ntells me that we had best go farther off the shore;  For,  says he,\\n look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast\\nasleep.  I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,\\nfor it was a terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore,\\nunder the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little\\nover him.  Xury,  says I,  you shall on shore and kill him.  Xury,\\nlooked frighted, and said,  Me kill! he eat me at one mouth! one\\nmouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie\\nstill, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and\\nloaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it\\ndown; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we\\nhad three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best\\naim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he\\nlay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit\\nhis leg about the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at\\nfirst, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got upon\\nthree legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a\\nlittle surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up\\nthe second piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired\\nagain, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop\\nand make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took\\nheart, and would have me let him go on shore.  Well, go,  said I: so\\nthe boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand, swam\\nto shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the\\nmuzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which\\ndespatched him quite.\\n\\nThis was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry\\nto lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good\\nfor nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he\\ncomes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.  For what, Xury? \\nsaid I.  Me cut off his head,  said he. However, Xury could not cut off\\nhis head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a\\nmonstrous great one.\\n\\nI bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one\\nway or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his\\nskin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much\\nthe better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it\\ntook us both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him,\\nand spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it\\nin two days  time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. WRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND\\n\\n\\nAfter this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or\\ntwelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to\\nabate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged\\nto for fresh water. My design in this was to make the river Gambia or\\nSenegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verde, where I was\\nin hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not\\nwhat course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there\\namong the negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed\\neither to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made\\nthis cape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my\\nfortune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship\\nor must perish.\\n\\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have\\nsaid, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three\\nplaces, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at\\nus; we could also perceive they were quite black and naked. I was once\\ninclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better\\ncounsellor, and said to me,  No go, no go.  However, I hauled in nearer\\nthe shore that I might talk to them, and I found they ran along the\\nshore by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hand,\\nexcept one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance,\\nand that they could throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at\\na distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and\\nparticularly made signs for something to eat: they beckoned to me to\\nstop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered\\nthe top of my sail and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country,\\nand in less than half-an-hour came back, and brought with them two\\npieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their\\ncountry; but we neither knew what the one or the other was; however, we\\nwere willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute,\\nfor I would not venture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid\\nof us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the\\nshore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we\\nfetched it on board, and then came close to us again.\\n\\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them\\namends; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them\\nwonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty\\ncreatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from\\nthe mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the\\nfemale, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,\\nany more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange, but I\\nbelieve it was the latter; because, in the first place, those ravenous\\ncreatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in the second place, we\\nfound the people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that\\nhad the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did; however,\\nas the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not offer to\\nfall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and\\nswam about, as if they had come for their diversion; at last one of\\nthem began to come nearer our boat than at first I expected; but I lay\\nready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition,\\nand bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my\\nreach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head; immediately he sank\\ndown into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if\\nhe were struggling for life, and so indeed he was; he immediately made\\nto the shore; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the\\nstrangling of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.\\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at\\nthe noise and fire of my gun: some of them were even ready to die for\\nfear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the\\ncreature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to\\ncome to the shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for\\nthe creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and by the\\nhelp of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to haul,\\nthey dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious\\nleopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held\\nup their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him\\nwith.\\n\\nThe other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of\\nthe gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from\\nwhence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I\\nfound quickly the negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so\\nI was willing to have them take it as a favour from me; which, when I\\nmade signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful\\nfor. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had no\\nknife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as\\nreadily, and much more readily, than we could have done with a knife.\\nThey offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that\\nI would give it them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me\\nvery freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions,\\nwhich, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs\\nto them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it\\nbottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it\\nfilled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and there\\ncame two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as\\nI supposed, in the sun, this they set down to me, as before, and I sent\\nXury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were\\nas naked as the men.\\n\\nI was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and\\nleaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,\\nwithout offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a\\ngreat length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five\\nleagues before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing\\nto make this point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues\\nfrom the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I\\nconcluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de\\nVerde, and those the islands called, from thence, Cape de Verde\\nIslands. However, they were at a great distance, and I could not well\\ntell what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of\\nwind, I might neither reach one or other.\\n\\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and\\nsat down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,\\n Master, master, a ship with a sail!  and the foolish boy was frighted\\nout of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master s ships\\nsent to pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach. I\\njumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but\\nthat it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the\\ncoast of Guinea, for negroes. But, when I observed the course she\\nsteered, I was soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did\\nnot design to come any nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out\\nto sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them if possible.\\n\\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in\\ntheir way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any\\nsignal to them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to\\ndespair, they, it seems, saw by the help of their glasses that it was\\nsome European boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship that\\nwas lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged\\nwith this, and as I had my patron s ancient on board, I made a waft of\\nit to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they\\nsaw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the\\ngun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me;\\nand in about three hours; time I came up with them.\\n\\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,\\nbut I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch sailor, who was on\\nboard, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an\\nEnglishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at\\nSallee; they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,\\nand all my goods.\\n\\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I\\nwas thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost\\nhopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to\\nthe captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he\\ngenerously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had\\nshould be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils.  For,  says\\nhe,  I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to\\nbe saved myself: and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken\\nup in the same condition. Besides,  said he,  when I carry you to the\\nBrazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from\\nyou what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away\\nthat life I have given. No, no,  says he:  Seignior Inglese  (Mr.\\nEnglishman),  I will carry you thither in charity, and those things\\nwill help to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home again. \\n\\nAs he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the\\nperformance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should\\ntouch anything that I had: then he took everything into his own\\npossession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might\\nhave them, even to my three earthen jars.\\n\\nAs to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he\\nwould buy it of me for his ship s use; and asked me what I would have\\nfor it? I told him he had been so generous to me in everything that I\\ncould not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to\\nhim: upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me\\neighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any\\none offered to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty\\npieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not\\nthat I was unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loth\\nto sell the poor boy s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in\\nprocuring my own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it\\nto be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an\\nobligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon\\nthis, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain\\nhave him.\\n\\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de\\nTodos los Santos, or All Saints  Bay, in about twenty-two days after.\\nAnd now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all\\nconditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.\\n\\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough remember:\\nhe would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for\\nthe leopard s skin, and forty for the lion s skin, which I had in my\\nboat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually\\ndelivered to me; and what I was willing to sell he bought of me, such\\nas the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of\\nbeeswax for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two\\nhundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock\\nI went on shore in the Brazils.\\n\\nI had not been long here before I was recommended to the house of a\\ngood honest man like himself, who had an _ingenio_, as they call it\\n(that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time,\\nand acquainted myself by that means with the manner of planting and\\nmaking of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they\\ngot rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle\\nthere, I would turn planter among them: resolving in the meantime to\\nfind out some way to get my money, which I had left in London, remitted\\nto me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalisation, I\\npurchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, and\\nformed a plan for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be\\nsuitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from\\nEngland.\\n\\nI had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English\\nparents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was.\\nI call him my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and\\nwe went on very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as\\nhis; and we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two\\nyears. However, we began to increase, and our land began to come into\\norder; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of\\nus a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to\\ncome. But we both wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had\\ndone wrong in parting with my boy Xury.\\n\\nBut, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great\\nwonder. I had no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment\\nquite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I\\ndelighted in, and for which I forsook my father s house, and broke\\nthrough all his good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very middle\\nstation, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to\\nbefore, and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have\\nstayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I had\\ndone; and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well\\nin England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off to\\ndo it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a\\ndistance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least\\nknowledge of me.\\n\\nIn this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.\\nI had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work\\nto be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived\\njust like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody\\nthere but himself. But how just has it been and how should all men\\nreflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others\\nthat are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be\\nconvinced of their former felicity by their experience I say, how just\\nhas it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island\\nof mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly\\ncompared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued,\\nI had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.\\n\\nI was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the\\nplantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me\\nup at sea, went back for the ship remained there, in providing his\\nlading and preparing for his voyage, nearly three months when telling\\nhim what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this\\nfriendly and sincere advice: Seignior Inglese,  says he (for so he\\nalways called me),  if you will give me letters, and a procuration in\\nform to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London to\\nsend your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in\\nsuch goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce\\nof them, God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are all\\nsubject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for\\none hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and\\nlet the hazard be run for the first; so that, if it come safe, you may\\norder the rest the same way, and, if it miscarry, you may have the\\nother half to have recourse to for your supply. \\n\\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not\\nbut be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly\\nprepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and\\na procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.\\n\\nI wrote the English captain s widow a full account of all my\\nadventures my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese\\ncaptain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was\\nnow in, with all other necessary directions for my supply; and when\\nthis honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the\\nEnglish merchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a full\\naccount of my story to a merchant in London, who represented it\\neffectually to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money, but out\\nof her own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for\\nhis humanity and charity to me.\\n\\nThe merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,\\nsuch as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at\\nLisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which,\\nwithout my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of\\nthem), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and\\nutensils necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to\\nme.\\n\\nWhen this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised\\nwith the joy of it; and my stood steward, the captain, had laid out the\\nfive pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to\\npurchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years \\nservice, and would not accept of any consideration, except a little\\ntobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own produce.\\n\\nNeither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such\\nas cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and\\ndesirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a very great\\nadvantage; so that I might say I had more than four times the value of\\nmy first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour I mean\\nin the advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I\\nbought me a negro slave, and an European servant also I mean another\\nbesides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.\\n\\nBut as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our\\ngreatest adversity, so it was with me. I went on the next year with\\ngreat success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco\\non my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my\\nneighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight,\\nwere well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from\\nLisbon: and now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be\\nfull of projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed,\\noften the ruin of the best heads in business. Had I continued in the\\nstation I was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet\\nbefallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet,\\nretired life, and of which he had so sensibly described the middle\\nstation of life to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was\\nstill to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly,\\nto increase my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in\\nmy future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages\\nwere procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish\\ninclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in\\ncontradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and\\nplain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of life, which\\nnature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make my\\nduty.\\n\\nAs I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could\\nnot be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of\\nbeing a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a\\nrash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the\\nthing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf\\nof human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent\\nwith life and a state of health in the world.\\n\\nTo come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of\\nmy story. You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in\\nthe Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my\\nplantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted\\nacquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among\\nthe merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my\\ndiscourses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two\\nvoyages to the coast of Guinea: the manner of trading with the negroes\\nthere, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles such\\nas beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the\\nlike not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants  teeth, &c., but\\nnegroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.\\n\\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,\\nbut especially to that part which related to the buying of negroes,\\nwhich was a trade at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as\\nfar as it was, had been carried on by assientos, or permission of the\\nkings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock: so that\\nfew negroes were bought, and these excessively dear.\\n\\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my\\nacquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them\\ncame to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much\\nupon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came\\nto make a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy,\\nthey told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;\\nthat they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for\\nnothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be\\ncarried on, because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they\\ncame home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes\\non shore privately, and divide them among their own plantations; and,\\nin a word, the question was whether I would go their supercargo in the\\nship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they\\noffered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes, without\\nproviding any part of the stock.\\n\\nThis was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any\\none that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look\\nafter, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and\\nwith a good stock upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and\\nestablished, and had nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for\\nthree or four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds\\nfrom England; and who in that time, and with that little addition,\\ncould scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds\\nsterling, and that increasing too for me to think of such a voyage was\\nthe most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could\\nbe guilty of.\\n\\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the\\noffer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father s\\ngood counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with\\nall my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my\\nabsence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I\\nmiscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or\\ncovenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my\\nplantation and effects in case of my death, making the captain of the\\nship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging\\nhim to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of\\nthe produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.\\n\\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and to\\nkeep up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have looked\\ninto my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have\\ndone and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so\\nprosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving\\ncircumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its\\ncommon hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect\\nparticular misfortunes to myself.\\n\\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy\\nrather than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and\\nthe cargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my\\npartners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st\\nSeptember 1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my\\nfather and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their\\nauthority, and the fool to my own interests.\\n\\nOur ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns\\nand fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had on\\nboard no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our\\ntrade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other\\ntrifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets,\\nand the like.\\n\\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the\\nnorthward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the\\nAfrican coast when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern\\nlatitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in those days. We\\nhad very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon our own\\ncoast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence,\\nkeeping further off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we\\nwere bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by\\nN., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the\\nline in about twelve days  time, and were, by our last observation, in\\nseven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent\\ntornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began\\nfrom the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled in\\nthe north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for\\ntwelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away\\nbefore it, let it carry us whither fate and the fury of the winds\\ndirected; and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected\\nevery day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect\\nto save their lives.\\n\\nIn this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our\\nmen die of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed overboard.\\nAbout the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an\\nobservation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven\\ndegrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude\\ndifference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was upon\\nthe coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river\\nAmazon, toward that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great\\nRiver; and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the\\nship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going directly back\\nto the coast of Brazil.\\n\\nI was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the\\nsea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited\\ncountry for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of\\nthe Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for\\nBarbadoes; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the\\nBay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about\\nfifteen days  sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to\\nthe coast of Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to\\nourselves.\\n\\nWith this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W., in\\norder to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief.\\nBut our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of\\ntwelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which\\ncarried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out\\nof the way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as\\nto the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than\\never returning to our own country.\\n\\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men\\nearly in the morning cried out,  Land!  and we had no sooner run out of\\nthe cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we\\nwere, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment her motion\\nbeing so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that we\\nexpected we should all have perished immediately; and we were\\nimmediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very\\nfoam and spray of the sea.\\n\\nIt is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to\\ndescribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We\\nknew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were\\ndriven whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not\\ninhabited. As the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less\\nthan at first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many\\nminutes without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of\\nmiracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking upon\\none another, and expecting death every moment, and every man,\\naccordingly, preparing for another world; for there was little or\\nnothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present comfort,\\nand all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the\\nship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to\\nabate.\\n\\nNow, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship\\nhaving thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to\\nexpect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had\\nnothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We\\nhad a boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved\\nby dashing against the ship s rudder, and in the next place she broke\\naway, and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope\\nfrom her. We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the\\nsea was a doubtful thing. However, there was no time to debate, for we\\nfancied that the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told\\nus she was actually broken already.\\n\\nIn this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with\\nthe help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship s side; and\\ngetting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in\\nnumber, to God s mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was\\nabated considerably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore,\\nand might be well called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the sea in a\\nstorm.\\n\\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that\\nthe sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should\\nbe inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor if we had\\ncould we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards\\nthe land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we\\nall knew that when the boat came near the shore she would be dashed in\\na thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our\\nsouls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us\\ntowards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands,\\npulling as well as we could towards land.\\n\\nWhat the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we\\nknew not. The only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow\\nof expectation was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of\\nsome river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got\\nunder the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was\\nnothing like this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore,\\nthe land looked more frightful than the sea.\\n\\nAfter we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a half, as we\\nreckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us,\\nand plainly bade us expect the _coup de gr ce_. It took us with such a\\nfury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from\\nthe boat as from one another, gave us no time to say,  O God!  for we\\nwere all swallowed up in a moment.\\n\\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sank\\ninto the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver\\nmyself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having\\ndriven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and\\nhaving spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry,\\nbut half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind,\\nas well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I\\nexpected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the\\nland as fast as I could before another wave should return and take me\\nup again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the\\nsea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy,\\nwhich I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to\\nhold my breath, and raise myself upon the water if I could; and so, by\\nswimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,\\nif possible, my greatest concern now being that the sea, as it would\\ncarry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry\\nme back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.\\n\\nThe wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty\\nfeet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a\\nmighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I\\nheld my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my\\nmight. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt\\nmyself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands\\nshoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was not two\\nseconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me\\ngreatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was covered again with\\nwater a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the\\nwater had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against\\nthe return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood\\nstill a few moments to recover breath, and till the waters went from\\nme, and then took to my heels and ran with what strength I had further\\ntowards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of\\nthe sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice more I was\\nlifted up by the waves and carried forward as before, the shore being\\nvery flat.\\n\\nThe last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for the sea\\nhaving hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,\\nagainst a piece of rock, and that with such force, that it left me\\nsenseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow\\ntaking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my\\nbody; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled\\nin the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,\\nand seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold\\nfast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,\\ntill the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at\\nfirst, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then\\nfetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that the next\\nwave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry\\nme away; and the next run I took, I got to the mainland, where, to my\\ngreat comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat me down\\nupon the grass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the\\nwater.\\n\\nI was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God\\nthat my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before\\nscarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the\\nlife, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so\\nsaved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at\\nthe custom, when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is\\ntied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to\\nhim I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let\\nhim blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may\\nnot drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him.\\n\\n For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. \\n\\n\\nI walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as\\nI may say, wrapped up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a\\nthousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon\\nall my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one\\nsoul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards,\\nor any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes\\nthat were not fellows.\\n\\nI cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the\\nsea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and\\nconsidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?\\n\\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition,\\nI began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what\\nwas next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a\\nword, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to\\nshift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither\\ndid I see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or\\nbeing devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly\\nafflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any\\ncreature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other\\ncreature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had\\nnothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a\\nbox. This was all my provisions; and this threw me into such terrible\\nagonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night\\ncoming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my\\nlot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they\\nalways come abroad for their prey.\\n\\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up\\ninto a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and\\nwhere I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death\\nI should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a\\nfurlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to\\ndrink, which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little\\ntobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and\\ngetting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so that if I should\\nsleep I might not fall. And having cut me a short stick, like a\\ntruncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and having been\\nexcessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as,\\nI believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself more\\nrefreshed with it than, I think, I ever was on such an occasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. FIRST WEEKS ON THE ISLAND\\n\\n\\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,\\nso that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that which\\nsurprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from\\nthe sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up\\nalmost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been\\nso bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a\\nmile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright\\nstill, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some\\nnecessary things for my use.\\n\\nWhen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me\\nagain, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind\\nand the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my\\nright hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to\\nher; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which\\nwas about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more\\nintent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my\\npresent subsistence.\\n\\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so\\nfar out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And\\nhere I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if\\nwe had kept on board we had been all safe that is to say, we had all\\ngot safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left\\nentirely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was. This forced\\ntears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I\\nresolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my\\nclothes for the weather was hot to extremity and took the water. But\\nwhen I came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to\\nget on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there\\nwas nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and\\nthe second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did\\nnot see at first, hung down by the fore-chains so low, as that with\\ngreat difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got\\nup into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was\\nbulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so\\non the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather earth, that her stern\\nlay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By\\nthis means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was\\ndry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what\\nwas spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found that all the ship s\\nprovisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well\\ndisposed to eat, I went to the bread room and filled my pockets with\\nbiscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to\\nlose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large\\ndram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was\\nbefore me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many\\nthings which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.\\n\\nIt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and\\nthis extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and\\ntwo or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the\\nship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of\\nthem overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with\\na rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done I went down\\nthe ship s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together\\nat both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two\\nor three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could\\nwalk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great\\nweight, the pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with a\\ncarpenter s saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added\\nthem to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of\\nfurnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I\\nshould have been able to have done upon another occasion.\\n\\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next\\ncare was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it\\nfrom the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this. I first\\nlaid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having\\nconsidered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen s chests,\\nwhich I had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon my\\nraft; the first of these I filled with provisions viz. bread, rice,\\nthree Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat s flesh (which we lived\\nmuch upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which had been\\nlaid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls\\nwere killed. There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my\\ngreat disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or\\nspoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several, cases of bottles\\nbelonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in\\nall, about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves,\\nthere being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.\\nWhile I was doing this, I found the tide begin to flow, though very\\ncalm; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,\\nwhich I had left on the shore, upon the sand, swim away. As for my\\nbreeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in\\nthem and my stockings. However, this set me on rummaging for clothes,\\nof which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present\\nuse, for I had others things which my eye was more upon as, first,\\ntools to work with on shore. And it was after long searching that I\\nfound out the carpenter s chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize\\nto me, and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have been\\nat that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing\\ntime to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.\\n\\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very good\\nfowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. These I secured\\nfirst, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old\\nrusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,\\nbut knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I\\nfound them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water. Those\\ntwo I got to my raft with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty\\nwell freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them,\\nhaving neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind\\nwould have overset all my navigation.\\n\\nI had three encouragements 1st, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide\\nrising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was\\nblew me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken\\noars belonging to the boat and, besides the tools which were in the\\nchest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer; with this cargo I put to\\nsea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that I\\nfound it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed\\nbefore; by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water,\\nand consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I\\nmight make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.\\n\\nAs I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening of\\nthe land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I\\nguided my raft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.\\n\\nBut here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I\\nhad, I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of\\nthe coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not\\nbeing aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my\\ncargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and to fallen\\ninto the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests,\\nto keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with\\nall my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but\\nholding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near\\nhalf-an-hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little\\nmore upon a level; and a little after, the water still-rising, my raft\\nfloated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the\\nchannel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the\\nmouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current\\nof tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to\\nshore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river: hoping\\nin time to see some ships at sea, and therefore resolved to place\\nmyself as near the coast as I could.\\n\\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to\\nwhich with great pain and difficulty I guided my raft, and at last got\\nso near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly\\nin. But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again;\\nfor that shore lying pretty steep that is to say sloping there was no\\nplace to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would\\nlie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would\\nendanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till the tide\\nwas at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to\\nhold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,\\nwhich I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I\\nfound water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water I thrust her\\nupon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by\\nsticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side near one\\nend, and one on the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till\\nthe water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.\\n\\nMy next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my\\nhabitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever\\nmight happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent or\\non an island; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of\\nwild beasts or not. There was a hill not above a mile from me, which\\nrose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other\\nhills, which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out one of the\\nfowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus\\narmed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where,\\nafter I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw my\\nfate, to my great affliction viz. that I was in an island environed\\nevery way with the sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay\\na great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which lay about\\nthree leagues to the west.\\n\\nI found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good\\nreason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however,\\nI saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds;\\nneither when I killed them could I tell what was fit for food, and what\\nnot. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon\\na tree on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that\\nhad been fired there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner\\nfired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable\\nnumber of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and crying,\\nand every one according to his usual note, but not one of them of any\\nkind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind\\nof hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or\\nclaws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.\\n\\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work\\nto bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day. What\\nto do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I\\nwas afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast\\nmight devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really no\\nneed for those fears.\\n\\nHowever, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chest\\nand boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that\\nnight s lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself,\\nexcept that I had seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the\\nwood where I shot the fowl.\\n\\nI now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of\\nthe ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the\\nrigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I\\nresolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And\\nas I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all\\nin pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I had got\\neverything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a\\ncouncil that is to say in my thoughts whether I should take back the\\nraft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before,\\nwhen the tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I\\nwent from my hut, having nothing on but my chequered shirt, a pair of\\nlinen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.\\n\\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and,\\nhaving had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy,\\nnor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very\\nuseful to me; as first, in the carpenters stores I found two or three\\nbags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of\\nhatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone.\\nAll these I secured, together with several things belonging to the\\ngunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket\\nbullets, seven muskets, another fowling-piece, with some small quantity\\nof powder more; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of\\nsheet-lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get\\nit over the ship s side.\\n\\nBesides these things, I took all the men s clothes that I could find,\\nand a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I\\nloaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very\\ngreat comfort.\\n\\nI was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land, that at\\nleast my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back I\\nfound no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat\\nupon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a\\nlittle distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and\\nunconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be\\nacquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but, as she did not\\nunderstand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer\\nto stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the\\nway, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however, I\\nspared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it,\\nand looked (as if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare\\nno more: so she marched off.\\n\\nHaving got my second cargo on shore though I was fain to open the\\nbarrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,\\nbeing large casks I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail\\nand some poles which I cut for that purpose: and into this tent I\\nbrought everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and\\nI piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,\\nto fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.\\n\\nWhen I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some\\nboards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading\\none of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head,\\nand my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept\\nvery quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night\\nbefore I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day to fetch\\nall those things from the ship, and to get them on shore.\\n\\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\\nbelieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship\\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of\\nher that I could; so every day at low water I went on board, and\\nbrought away something or other; but particularly the third time I went\\nI brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small\\nropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which\\nwas to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.\\nIn a word, I brought away all the sails, first and last; only that I\\nwas fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could,\\nfor they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.\\n\\nBut that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I\\nhad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with I say,\\nafter all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets\\nof rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this\\nwas surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more\\nprovisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the\\nhogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces\\nof the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on\\nshore also.\\n\\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship\\nof what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables.\\nCutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two\\ncables and a hawser on shore, with all the ironwork I could get; and\\nhaving cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything\\nI could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods,\\nand came away. But my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft\\nwas so unwieldy, and so overladen, that, after I had entered the little\\ncove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide\\nit so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my\\ncargo into the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was\\nnear the shore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost,\\nespecially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to\\nme; however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of the\\ncable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I\\nwas fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very\\nmuch. After this, I went every day on board, and brought away what I\\ncould get.\\n\\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on\\nboard the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of\\nhands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily,\\nhad the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship,\\npiece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found\\nthe wind began to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and\\nthough I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing\\nmore could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in\\none of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large\\nscissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks: in another\\nI found about thirty-six pounds value in money some European coin, some\\nBrazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.\\n\\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money:  O drug!  said I, aloud,\\n what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me no, not the taking\\noff the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap; I have no\\nmanner of use for thee e en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom\\nas a creature whose life is not worth saving.  However, upon second\\nthoughts I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I\\nbegan to think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this,\\nI found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter\\nof an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred\\nto me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind\\noffshore; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of\\nflood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.\\nAccordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the\\nchannel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with\\ndifficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me,\\nand partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily,\\nand before it was quite high water it blew a storm.\\n\\nBut I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth\\nabout me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in the morning,\\nwhen I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I was a little\\nsurprised, but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection that I\\nhad lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of\\nher that could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left\\nin her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.\\n\\nI now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of\\nher, except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed,\\ndivers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use\\nto me.\\n\\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against\\neither savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in\\nthe island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and\\nwhat kind of dwelling to make whether I should make me a cave in the\\nearth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both;\\nthe manner and description of which, it may not be improper to give an\\naccount of.\\n\\nI soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because\\nit was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it\\nwould not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was no\\nfresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more\\nconvenient spot of ground.\\n\\nI consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be\\nproper for me: 1st, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned;\\n2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous\\ncreatures, whether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God\\nsent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my\\ndeliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation\\nyet.\\n\\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the\\nside of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep\\nas a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.\\nOn the one side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way\\nin, like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any\\ncave or way into the rock at all.\\n\\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\\npitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and\\nabout twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the\\nend of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by\\nthe seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was\\nsheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun,\\nor thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.\\n\\nBefore I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,\\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\\ntwenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending.\\n\\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them\\ninto the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end\\nbeing out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on\\nthe top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\\n\\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid\\nthem in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two\\nrows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,\\nleaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a\\npost; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could\\nget into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour,\\nespecially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and\\ndrive them into the earth.\\n\\nThe entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a\\nshort ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted\\nover after me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I\\nthought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the\\nnight, which otherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared\\nafterwards, there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that\\nI apprehended danger from.\\n\\nInto this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my\\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have\\nthe account above; and I made a large tent, which to preserve me from\\nthe rains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made\\ndouble one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and\\ncovered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among\\nthe sails.\\n\\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on\\nshore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged\\nto the mate of the ship.\\n\\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would\\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\\nentrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,\\nas I said, by a short ladder.\\n\\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and\\nbringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent,\\nI laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it\\nraised the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a\\ncave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.\\n\\nIt cost me much labour and many days before all these things were\\nbrought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some other\\nthings which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,\\nafter I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the\\ncave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden\\nflash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as\\nis naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the\\nlightning as I was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift\\nas the lightning itself Oh, my powder! My very heart sank within me\\nwhen I thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on\\nwhich, not my defence only, but the providing my food, as I thought,\\nentirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger,\\nthough, had the powder took fire, I should never have known who had\\nhurt me.\\n\\nSuch impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over I\\nlaid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself\\nto make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little\\nand a little in a parcel, in the hope that, whatever might come, it\\nmight not all take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should\\nnot be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in\\nabout a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about two\\nhundred and forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred\\nparcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any\\ndanger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I\\ncalled my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the\\nrocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I\\nlaid it.\\n\\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least\\nevery day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I could\\nkill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself\\nwith what the island produced. The first time I went out, I presently\\ndiscovered that there were goats in the island, which was a great\\nsatisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to\\nme viz. that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it\\nwas the most difficult thing in the world to come at them; but I was\\nnot discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot\\none, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a little,\\nI laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw me in the\\nvalleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a\\nterrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was\\nupon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded\\nthat, by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed\\ndownward that they did not readily see objects that were above them; so\\nafterwards I took this method I always climbed the rocks first, to get\\nabove them, and then had frequently a fair mark.\\n\\nThe first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which\\nhad a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me\\nheartily; for when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her,\\ntill I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the\\nold one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my\\nenclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,\\nand carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it\\nwould not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself. These two\\nsupplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my\\nprovisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could.\\n\\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn: and what I did for\\nthat, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\\nshall give a full account of in its place; but I must now give some\\nlittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it\\nmay well be supposed, were not a few.\\n\\nI had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away\\nupon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm,\\nquite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.\\nsome hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of\\nmankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of\\nHeaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I\\nshould end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I\\nmade these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself\\nwhy Providence should thus completely ruin His creatures, and render\\nthem so absolutely miserable; so without help, abandoned, so entirely\\ndepressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a\\nlife.\\n\\nBut something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,\\nand to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my\\nhand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\\ncondition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,\\nthus:  Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray\\nremember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come, eleven of you in\\nthe boat? Where are the ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why\\nwere you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?  And then I\\npointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that\\nis in them, and with what worse attends them.\\n\\nThen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\\nsubsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened\\n(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the\\nplace where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore that\\nI had time to get all these things out of her; what would have been my\\ncase, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at\\nfirst came on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to\\nsupply and procure them?  Particularly,  said I, aloud (though to\\nmyself),  what should I have done without a gun, without ammunition,\\nwithout any tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes,\\nbedding, a tent, or any manner of covering?  and that now I had all\\nthese to sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself\\nin such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was\\nspent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want,\\nas long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I would\\nprovide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time that was\\nto come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even\\nafter my health and strength should decay.\\n\\nI confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\\ndestroyed at one blast I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;\\nand this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened\\nand thundered, as I observed just now.\\n\\nAnd now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of\\nsilent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before,\\nI shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It\\nwas by my account the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above\\nsaid, I first set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to\\nus in its autumnal equinox, was almost over my head; for I reckoned\\nmyself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees\\ntwenty-two minutes north of the line.\\n\\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my\\nthoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and\\npen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent\\nthis, I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters and\\nmaking it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first\\nlanded I came on shore here on the 30th September 1659. \\n\\nUpon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my\\nknife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every\\nfirst day of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept\\nmy calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.\\n\\nIn the next place, we are to observe that among the many things which I\\nbrought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above\\nmentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at\\nall less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as, in\\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain s,\\nmate s, gunner s and carpenter s keeping; three or four compasses, some\\nmathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of\\nnavigation, all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or\\nno; also, I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo\\nfrom England, and which I had packed up among my things; some\\nPortuguese books also; and among them two or three Popish prayer-books,\\nand several other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not\\nforget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent\\nhistory I may have occasion to say something in its place; for I\\ncarried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the\\nship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore\\nwith my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years; I\\nwanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could\\nmake up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not\\ndo. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded\\nthem to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept\\nthings very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not\\nmake any ink by any means that I could devise.\\n\\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things notwithstanding all\\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a\\nspade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,\\nand thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near\\na whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or\\nsurrounded my habitation. The piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as\\nI could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the\\nwoods, and more, by far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes\\ntwo days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third\\nday in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy\\npiece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron\\ncrows; which, however, though I found it, made driving those posts or\\npiles very laborious and tedious work.\\n\\n\\nBut what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I\\nhad to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other\\nemployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee,\\nexcept the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or\\nless, every day.\\n\\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I\\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not\\nso much to leave them to any that were to come after me for I was\\nlikely to have but few heirs as to deliver my thoughts from daily\\nporing over them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to\\nmaster my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could,\\nand to set the good against the evil, that I might have something to\\ndistinguish my case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like\\ndebtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I\\nsuffered, thus: \\n\\n\\n_Evil_.\\n\\n\\n_Good_.\\n\\n\\nI am cast upon a horrible, desolate island, void of all hope of\\nrecovery.\\n\\n\\nBut I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship s company were.\\n\\n\\nI am singled out and separated, as it were, from all the world, to be\\nmiserable.\\n\\n\\nBut I am singled out, too, from all the ship s crew, to be spared from\\ndeath; and He that miraculously saved me from death can deliver me from\\nthis condition.\\n\\n\\nI am divided from mankind a solitaire; one banished from human society.\\n\\n\\nBut I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place, affording no\\nsustenance.\\n\\n\\nI have no clothes to cover me.\\n\\n\\nBut I am in a hot climate, where, if I had clothes, I could hardly wear\\nthem.\\n\\n\\nI am without any defence, or means to resist any violence of man or\\nbeast.\\n\\n\\nBut I am cast on an island where I see no wild beasts to hurt me, as I\\nsaw on the coast of Africa; and what if I had been shipwrecked there?\\n\\n\\nI have no soul to speak to or relieve me.\\n\\n\\nBut God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the shore, that I\\nhave got out as many necessary things as will either supply my wants or\\nenable me to supply myself, even as long as I live.\\n\\n\\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce\\nany condition in the world so miserable but there was something\\nnegative or something positive to be thankful for in it; and let this\\nstand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all\\nconditions in this world: that we may always find in it something to\\ncomfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and\\nevil, on the credit side of the account.\\n\\nHaving now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship I say, giving\\nover these things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living,\\nand to make things as easy to me as I could.\\n\\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\\nof a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables: but I\\nmight now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against\\nit of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside; and after some time\\n(I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to\\nthe rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such\\nthings as I could get, to keep out the rain; which I found at some\\ntimes of the year very violent.\\n\\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\\ninto the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that\\nat first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no\\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I\\nset myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it\\nwas a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed\\non it: and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I\\nworked sideways, to the right hand, into the rock; and then, turning to\\nthe right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on\\nthe outside of my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress\\nand regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but\\ngave me room to store my goods.\\n\\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I\\nfound I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without\\nthese I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I\\ncould not write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure\\nwithout a table: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that\\nas reason is the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating\\nand squaring everything by reason, and by making the most rational\\njudgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic\\nart. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by\\nlabour, application, and contrivance, I found at last that I wanted\\nnothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools.\\nHowever, I made abundance of things, even without tools; and some with\\nno more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made\\nthat way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I\\nwanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an\\nedge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I\\nbrought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze.\\nIt is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole\\ntree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had\\nfor the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make\\na plank or board: but my time or labour was little worth, and so it was\\nas well employed one way as another.\\n\\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the\\nfirst place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I\\nbrought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out some\\nboards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a\\nhalf, one over another all along one side of my cave, to lay all my\\ntools, nails and ironwork on; and, in a word, to separate everything at\\nlarge into their places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked\\npieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that\\nwould hang up; so that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a\\ngeneral magazine of all necessary things; and had everything so ready\\nat my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in\\nsuch order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so\\ngreat.\\n\\nAnd now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day s\\nemployment; for, indeed, at first I was in too much hurry, and not only\\nhurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind; and my\\njournal would have been full of many dull things; for example, I must\\nhave said thus:  30_th_. After I had got to shore, and escaped\\ndrowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having\\nfirst vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which had got into\\nmy stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore\\nwringing my hands and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my\\nmisery, and crying out,  I was undone, undone!  till, tired and faint,\\nI was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep\\nfor fear of being devoured. \\n\\nSome days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got\\nall that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the\\ntop of a little mountain and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a\\nship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please myself with\\nthe hopes of it, and then after looking steadily, till I was almost\\nblind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus\\nincrease my misery by my folly.\\n\\nBut having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled\\nmy household staff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all\\nas handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal; of which I\\nshall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these\\nparticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I\\nwas forced to leave it off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. BUILDS A HOUSE THE JOURNAL\\n\\n\\nSeptember 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being\\nshipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on\\nthis dismal, unfortunate island, which I called  The Island of\\nDespair ; all the rest of the ship s company being drowned, and myself\\nalmost dead.\\n\\nAll the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal\\ncircumstances I was brought to viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,\\nweapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing\\nbut death before me either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,\\nmurdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the\\napproach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but\\nslept soundly, though it rained all night.\\n\\n_October_ 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had\\nfloated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer\\nthe island; which, as it was some comfort, on one hand for, seeing her\\nset upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I\\nmight get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my\\nrelief so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my\\ncomrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have\\nsaved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned\\nas they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have\\nbuilt us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some\\nother part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing\\nmyself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I\\nwent upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day\\nalso it continued raining, though with no wind at all.\\n\\n_From the 1st of October to the 24th_. All these days entirely spent in\\nmany several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I\\nbrought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also in the\\ndays, though with some intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was\\nthe rainy season.\\n\\n_Oct._ 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but,\\nbeing in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered\\nmany of them when the tide was out.\\n\\n_Oct._ 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;\\nduring which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little\\nharder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of\\nher, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and\\nsecuring the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil\\nthem.\\n\\n_Oct._ 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place\\nto fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any\\nattack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I\\nfixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle\\nfor my encampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or\\nfortification, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and\\nwithout with turf.\\n\\nFrom the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my goods\\nto my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained\\nexceedingly hard.\\n\\nThe 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to\\nseek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat,\\nand her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because\\nit would not feed.\\n\\n_November_ 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the\\nfirst night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to\\nswing my hammock upon.\\n\\n_Nov._ 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber\\nwhich made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little\\nwithin the place I had marked out for my fortification.\\n\\n_Nov._ 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks,\\nwhich were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a\\ntable.\\n\\n_Nov_. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out\\nwith my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion viz. every morning I\\nwalked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then\\nemployed myself to work till about eleven o clock; then eat what I had\\nto live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather\\nbeing excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The\\nworking part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making\\nmy table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and\\nnecessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe\\nthey would do any one else.\\n\\n_Nov._ 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a\\nwild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every\\ncreature that I killed I took of the skins and preserved them. Coming\\nback by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not\\nunderstand; but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three\\nseals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,\\ngot into the sea, and escaped me for that time.\\n\\n_Nov._ 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my table again, and\\nfinished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned\\nto mend it.\\n\\n_Nov._ 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,\\n10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up\\nto make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape,\\nbut never to please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces\\nseveral times.\\n\\n_Note_. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for\\nthem on my post, I forgot which was which.\\n\\n_Nov._ 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and\\ncooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and\\nlightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As\\nsoon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as\\nmany little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.\\n\\n_Nov._ 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little square\\nchests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at\\nmost, of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places\\nas secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these\\nthree days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not\\nwhat to call it.\\n\\n_Nov._ 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to\\nmake room for my further conveniency.\\n\\n_Note_. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work viz. a pickaxe,\\na shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and\\nbegan to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As\\nfor the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper\\nenough, though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this\\nwas so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing\\neffectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.\\n\\n_Nov._ 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that\\nwood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its\\nexceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my\\naxe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,\\nfor it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my\\nhaving no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I\\nworked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or\\nspade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the\\nboard part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me\\nso long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had\\noccasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after\\nthat fashion, or so long in making.\\n\\nI was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A basket\\nI could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that\\nwould bend to make wicker-ware at least, none yet found out; and as to\\na wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had\\nno notion of; neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no\\npossible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the\\nwheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth\\nwhich I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the\\nlabourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not\\nso difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the\\nshovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,\\ntook me up no less than four days I mean always excepting my morning\\nwalk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also\\nbringing home something fit to eat.\\n\\n_Nov._ 23. My other work having now stood still, because of my making\\nthese tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day,\\nas my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in\\nwidening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods\\ncommodiously.\\n\\n_Note_. During all this time I worked to make this room or cave\\nspacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a\\nkitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the\\ntent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained\\nso hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to\\ncover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of\\nrafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large\\nleaves of trees, like a thatch.\\n\\n_December_ 10. I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on\\na sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth\\nfell down from the top on one side; so much that, in short, it frighted\\nme, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had\\nnever wanted a gravedigger. I had now a great deal of work to do over\\nagain, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more\\nimportance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no\\nmore would come down.\\n\\n_Dec_. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two\\nshores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards\\nacross over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more\\nposts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured, and\\nthe posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off the\\nhouse.\\n\\n_Dec._ 17. From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up\\nnails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up; and\\nnow I began to be in some order within doors.\\n\\n_Dec._ 20. Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish\\nmy house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my\\nvictuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made\\nme another table.\\n\\n_Dec._ 24. Much rain all night and all day. No stirring out.\\n\\n_Dec._ 25. Rain all day.\\n\\n_Dec._ 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and\\npleasanter.\\n\\n_Dec._ 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught it\\nand led it home in a string; when I had it at home, I bound and\\nsplintered up its leg, which was broke.\\n\\n_N.B._ I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and\\nas strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed\\nupon the little green at my door, and would not go away. This was the\\nfirst time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame\\ncreatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was all\\nspent.\\n\\n_Dec._ 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no\\nstirring abroad except in the evening for food; this time I spent in\\nputting all my things in order within doors.\\n\\n_January_ 1. Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my\\ngun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going\\nfarther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I\\nfound there were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to\\ncome at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt\\nthem down.\\n\\n_Jan._ 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him\\nupon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the\\ndog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.\\n\\n_Jan._ 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my\\nbeing attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.\\n\\n_N.B._ This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said\\nin the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time\\nthan from the 2nd of January to the 14th of April working, finishing,\\nand perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about twenty-four\\nyards in length, being a half-circle from one place in the rock to\\nanother place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in\\nthe centre behind it.\\n\\nAll this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days,\\nnay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never be\\nperfectly secure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible\\nwhat inexpressible labour everything was done with, especially the\\nbringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground; for I\\nmade them much bigger than I needed to have done.\\n\\nWhen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with a turf\\nwall raised up close to it, I perceived myself that if any people were\\nto come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a\\nhabitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed\\nhereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.\\n\\nDuring this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when\\nthe rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of\\nsomething or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of\\nwild pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as\\nhouse-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I\\nendeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older\\nthey flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them,\\nfor I had nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their\\nnests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat. And now, in\\nthe managing my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many\\nthings, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as,\\nindeed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could never make a\\ncask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before;\\nbut I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though\\nI spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join\\nthe staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave\\nthat also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles;\\nso that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven\\no clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax\\nwith which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of\\nthat now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I\\nsaved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in\\nthe sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and\\nthis gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle. In\\nthe middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I\\nfound a little bag which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn\\nfor the feeding of poultry not for this voyage, but before, as I\\nsuppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn\\nthat had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw\\nnothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the\\nbag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided\\nit for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of\\ncorn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.\\n\\nIt was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw\\nthis stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that\\nI had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts,\\nI saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,\\nwhich I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was\\nsurprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,\\nI saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green\\nbarley, of the same kind as our European nay, as our English barley.\\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my\\nthoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious\\nfoundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my\\nhead, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me\\notherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God,\\nwithout so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these\\nthings, or His order in governing events for the world. But after I saw\\nbarley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,\\nand especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me\\nstrangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His\\ngrain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so\\ndirected purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.\\n\\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I\\nbegan to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon\\nmy account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it\\nstill, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,\\nwhich proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen\\nit grow in Africa when I was ashore there.\\n\\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my\\nsupport, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all\\nover that part of the island, where I had been before, peering in every\\ncorner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not\\nfind any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I shook a bag of\\nchickens  meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease;\\nand I must confess my religious thankfulness to God s providence began\\nto abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what\\nwas common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and\\nunforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really\\nthe work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or\\ntwelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had\\ndestroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also,\\nthat I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in\\nthe shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had\\nthrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been burnt up and\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their\\nseason, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I\\nresolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity\\nsufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year\\nthat I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even\\nthen but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost\\nall that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for\\nI sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all,\\nat least not as it would have done; of which in its place.\\n\\nBesides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of\\nrice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to\\nthe same purpose to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to\\ncook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.\\n\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\n\\nI worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;\\nand the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by\\na door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on\\nthe outside of my habitation.\\n\\n_April_ 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,\\nand then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside. This was\\na complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing\\ncould come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.\\n\\nThe very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had all my\\nlabour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus: As I\\nwas busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my\\ncave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful, surprising thing\\nindeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from\\nthe roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and\\ntwo of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful\\nmanner. I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was really\\nthe cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some\\nof it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it I ran\\nforward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got\\nover my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might\\nroll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,\\nthan I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood\\non shook three times at about eight minutes  distance, with three such\\nshocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be\\nsupposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a\\nrock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with\\nsuch a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also\\nthe very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the\\nshocks were stronger under the water than on the island.\\n\\nI was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,\\nnor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or\\nstupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one\\nthat was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock\\nawakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I\\nwas in, filled me with horror; and I thought of nothing then but the\\nhill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all\\nat once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.\\n\\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I\\nbegan to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my\\nwall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the\\nground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All\\nthis while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but\\nthe common  Lord have mercy upon me!  and when it was over that went\\naway too.\\n\\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it\\nwould rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so\\nthat in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the\\nsea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was\\ncovered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the\\nroots, and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and\\nthen began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began\\nto rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground very much\\nterrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that\\nthese winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the\\nearthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave\\nagain. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also\\nhelping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain\\nwas so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I\\nwas forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for\\nfear it should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new\\nwork viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to\\nlet the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave. After I\\nhad been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of\\nthe earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now, to support\\nmy spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little\\nstore, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and\\nalways very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.\\nIt continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so\\nthat I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began\\nto think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was\\nsubject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a\\ncave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place\\nwhich I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make\\nmyself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed\\nwhere I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.\\n\\nWith these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where\\nit stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and\\nwhich, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent;\\nand I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in\\ncontriving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being\\nswallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the\\napprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it;\\nbut still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in\\norder, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it\\nmade me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that\\nit would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must\\nbe contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for\\nmyself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this\\nresolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go\\nto work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c.,\\nin a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished;\\nbut that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and\\nfit to remove. This was the 21st.\\n\\n_April_ 22. The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this\\nresolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools. I had\\nthree large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the\\nhatchets for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and\\ncutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and\\nthough I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.\\nThis cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a\\ngrand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.\\nAt length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot,\\nthat I might have both my hands at liberty. _Note_. I had never seen\\nany such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was\\ndone, though since I have observed, it is very common there; besides\\nthat, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a\\nfull week s work to bring it to perfection.\\n\\n_April_ 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my\\nmachine for turning my grindstone performing very well.\\n\\n_April_ 30. Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I\\ntook a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day,\\nwhich made my heart very heavy.\\n\\n_May_ 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the tide being\\nlow, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it\\nlooked like a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two\\nor three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by\\nthe late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it\\nseemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined\\nthe barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of\\ngunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as\\na stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and\\nwent on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to\\nlook for more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. ILL AND CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN\\n\\n\\nWhen I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed. The\\nforecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six\\nfeet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and parted from the rest\\nby the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was\\ntossed as it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so\\nhigh on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place\\nof water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of\\nthe wreck without swimming I could now walk quite up to her when the\\ntide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it\\nmust be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was\\nmore broke open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore,\\nwhich the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by\\ndegrees to the land.\\n\\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my\\nhabitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in\\nsearching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found\\nnothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship\\nwas choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of\\nanything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of the\\nship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be of some\\nuse or other to me.\\n\\n_May_ 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which\\nI thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and\\nwhen I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could\\nfrom the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged\\nto give over for that time.\\n\\n_May_ 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of,\\ntill I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a\\nyoung dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had\\nno hooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to\\neat; all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.\\n\\n_May_ 5. Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought\\nthree great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and\\nmade to float on shore when the tide of flood came on.\\n\\n_May_ 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her and\\nother pieces of ironwork. Worked very hard, and came home very much\\ntired, and had thoughts of giving it over.\\n\\n_May_ 7. Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but found\\nthe weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut;\\nthat several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of\\nthe hold lay so open that I could see into it; but it was almost full\\nof water and sand.\\n\\n_May_ 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the\\ndeck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open\\ntwo planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the\\niron crow in the wreck for next day.\\n\\n_May_ 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of\\nthe wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but\\ncould not break them up. I felt also a roll of English lead, and could\\nstir it, but it was too heavy to remove.\\n\\n_May_ 10 14. Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces\\nof timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight of\\niron.\\n\\n_May_ 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off\\nthe roll of lead by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with\\nthe other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could\\nnot make any blow to drive the hatchet.\\n\\n_May_ 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more\\nbroken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to\\nget pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck\\nthat day.\\n\\n_May_ 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great\\ndistance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were,\\nand found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring\\naway.\\n\\n_May_ 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard\\nlabour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first\\nflowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen s chests;\\nbut the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but\\npieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but\\nthe salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every\\nday to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I\\nalways appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the\\ntide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this\\ntime I had got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a\\ngood boat, if I had known how; and also I got, at several times and in\\nseveral pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.\\n\\n_June_ 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise or\\nturtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my\\nmisfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I\\nhappened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had\\nhundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid\\ndear enough for them.\\n\\n_June_ 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three-score\\neggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and\\npleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of\\ngoats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.\\n\\n_June_ 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at this time\\nthe rain felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not\\nusual in that latitude.\\n\\n_June_ 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.\\n\\n_June_ 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.\\n\\n_June_ 21. Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of\\nmy sad condition to be sick, and no help. Prayed to God, for the first\\ntime since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my\\nthoughts being all confused.\\n\\n_June_ 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of\\nsickness.\\n\\n_June_ 23. Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent\\nheadache.\\n\\n_June_ 24. Much better.\\n\\n_June_ 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold fit\\nand hot, with faint sweats after it.\\n\\n_June_ 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but\\nfound myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and with much\\ndifficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate, I would fain\\nhave stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.\\n\\n_June_ 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and\\nneither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I\\nhad not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.\\nPrayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so\\nignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried,  Lord, look\\nupon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!  I suppose I did\\nnothing else for two or three hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell\\nasleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found\\nmyself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I\\nhad no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and\\nwent to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I\\nthought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall,\\nwhere I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a\\nman descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and\\nlight upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I\\ncould but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most\\ninexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he\\nstepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,\\njust as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked,\\nto my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He\\nwas no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me,\\nwith a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came\\nto a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me or I heard a voice\\nso terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that\\nI can say I understood was this:  Seeing all these things have not\\nbrought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;  at which words, I\\nthought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.\\n\\nNo one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be\\nable to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. I\\nmean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors.\\nNor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained\\nupon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.\\n\\nI had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the good\\ninstruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series,\\nfor eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation\\nwith none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last\\ndegree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought\\nthat so much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or\\ninwards towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity\\nof soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely\\noverwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,\\nwicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not\\nhaving the least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of\\nthankfulness to God in deliverance.\\n\\nIn the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more\\neasily believed when I shall add, that through all the variety of\\nmiseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one\\nthought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment\\nfor my sin my rebellious behaviour against my father or my present\\nsins, which were great or so much as a punishment for the general\\ncourse of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the\\ndesert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what\\nwould become of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither I should\\ngo, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as\\nwell from voracious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely\\nthoughtless of a God or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the\\nprinciples of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and,\\nindeed, hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the\\nPortugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as\\nwell as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts.\\nWhen, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on\\nthis island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment.\\nI only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to\\nbe always miserable.\\n\\nIt is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship s\\ncrew drowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy,\\nand some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted,\\nmight have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began,\\nin a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was\\nalive, without the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of\\nthe hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved\\nwhen all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been\\nthus merciful unto me. Even just the same common sort of joy which\\nseamen generally have, after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck,\\nwhich they drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as\\nsoon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it. Even when\\nI was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of my condition,\\nhow I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,\\nout of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw\\nbut a prospect of living and that I should not starve and perish for\\nhunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began to be very\\neasy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and\\nsupply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a\\njudgment from heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were\\nthoughts which very seldom entered my head.\\n\\nThe growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first\\nsome little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness,\\nas long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as\\never that part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was\\nraised from it wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the\\nearthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or\\nmore immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs\\nsuch things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the\\nimpression it had made went off also. I had no more sense of God or His\\njudgments much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being\\nfrom His hand than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of\\nlife. But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the\\nmiseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began\\nto sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was\\nexhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so\\nlong, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life,\\nin which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the\\njustice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in\\nso vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second\\nor third day of my distemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever\\nas of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words\\nfrom me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a\\nprayer attended with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of\\nmere fright and distress. My thoughts were confused, the convictions\\ngreat upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable\\ncondition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; and\\nin these hurries of my soul I knew not what my tongue might express.\\nBut it was rather exclamation, such as,  Lord, what a miserable\\ncreature am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of\\nhelp; and what will become of me!  Then the tears burst out of my eyes,\\nand I could say no more for a good while. In this interval the good\\nadvice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction,\\nwhich I mentioned at the beginning of this story viz. that if I did\\ntake this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have\\nleisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when\\nthere might be none to assist in my recovery.  Now,  said I, aloud,  my\\ndear father s words are come to pass; God s justice has overtaken me,\\nand I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,\\nwhich had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I\\nmight have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself nor\\nlearn to know the blessing of it from my parents. I left them to mourn\\nover my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it.\\nI abused their help and assistance, who would have lifted me in the\\nworld, and would have made everything easy to me; and now I have\\ndifficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to\\nsupport, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.  Then I\\ncried out,  Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress.  This was the\\nfirst prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years.\\n\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\n\\n_June_ 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and\\nthe fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror\\nof my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague\\nwould return again the next day, and now was my time to get something\\nto refresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing\\nI did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon\\nmy table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish\\ndisposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into\\nit, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat s flesh\\nand broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about,\\nbut was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense\\nof my miserable condition, dreading, the return of my distemper the\\nnext day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle s eggs,\\nwhich I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, and\\nthis was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God s blessing to, that\\nI could remember, in my whole life. After I had eaten I tried to walk,\\nbut found myself so weak that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never\\nwent out without that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon\\nthe ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and\\nvery calm and smooth. As I sat here some such thoughts as these\\noccurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so\\nmuch? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other creatures\\nwild and tame, human and brutal? Whence are we? Sure we are all made by\\nsome secret Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And\\nwho is that? Then it followed most naturally, it is God that has made\\nall. Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these\\nthings, He guides and governs them all, and all things that concern\\nthem; for the Power that could make all things must certainly have\\npower to guide and direct them. If so, nothing can happen in the great\\ncircuit of His works, either without His knowledge or appointment.\\n\\nAnd if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here,\\nand am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His\\nappointment, He has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred\\nto my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it\\nrested upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that God\\nhad appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought into this\\nmiserable circumstance by His direction, He having the sole power, not\\nof me only, but of everything that happened in the world. Immediately\\nit followed: Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus\\nused? My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had\\nblasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice:  Wretch! dost\\n_thou_ ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent\\nlife, and ask thyself what thou hast _not_ done? Ask, why is it that\\nthou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth\\nRoads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee\\nman-of-war; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or\\ndrowned _here_, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost _thou_\\nask, what have I done?  I was struck dumb with these reflections, as\\none astonished, and had not a word to say no, not to answer to myself,\\nbut rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up\\nover my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly\\ndisturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my\\nchair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the\\napprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it\\noccurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their\\ntobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of\\ntobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that\\nwas green, and not quite cured.\\n\\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure\\nboth for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked\\nfor, the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I\\ntook out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this\\ntime I had not found leisure or inclination to look into. I say, I took\\nit out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.\\nWhat use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether\\nit was good for it or no: but I tried several experiments with it, as\\nif I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece\\nof leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost\\nstupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had\\nnot been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two\\nin some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and\\nlastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over\\nthe smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as\\nalmost for suffocation. In the interval of this operation I took up the\\nBible and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the\\ntobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the\\nbook casually, the first words that occurred to me were these,  Call on\\nMe in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt\\nglorify Me.  These words were very apt to my case, and made some\\nimpression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so\\nmuch as they did afterwards; for, as for being _delivered_, the word\\nhad no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so\\nimpossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the\\nchildren of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat,  Can God\\nspread a table in the wilderness?  so I began to say,  Can God Himself\\ndeliver me from this place?  And as it was not for many years that any\\nhopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but,\\nhowever, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon\\nthem very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,\\ndozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp\\nburning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went\\nto bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my\\nlife I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me,\\nthat if I called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me.\\nAfter my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which\\nI had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco\\nthat I could scarcely get it down; immediately upon this I went to bed.\\nI found presently it flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a\\nsound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be\\nnear three o clock in the afternoon the next day nay, to this hour I am\\npartly of opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till\\nalmost three the day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose\\na day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some\\nyears after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing\\nthe line, I should have lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a\\nday in my account, and never knew which way. Be that, however, one way\\nor the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and\\nmy spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was\\nthe day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short,\\nI had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better.\\nThis was the 29th.\\n\\nThe 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but\\ndid not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something\\nlike a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to\\neat them; so I ate some more of the turtle s eggs, which were very\\ngood. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me\\ngood the day before the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so\\nmuch as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over\\nthe smoke; however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first\\nof July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the\\ncold fit, but it was not much.\\n\\n_July_ 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself\\nwith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.\\n\\n_July_ 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover\\nmy full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering\\nstrength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture,  I will\\ndeliver thee ; and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my\\nmind, in bar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself\\nwith such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my\\ndeliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the\\ndeliverance I had received, and I was as it were made to ask myself\\nsuch questions as these viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully\\ntoo, from sickness from the most distressed condition that could be,\\nand that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? Had\\nI done my part? God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him that\\nis to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance;\\nand how could I expect greater deliverance? This touched my heart very\\nmuch; and immediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my\\nrecovery from my sickness.\\n\\n_July_ 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New\\nTestament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to\\nread a while every morning and every night; not tying myself to the\\nnumber of chapters, but long as my thoughts should engage me. It was\\nnot long after I set seriously to this work till I found my heart more\\ndeeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The\\nimpression of my dream revived; and the words,  All these things have\\nnot brought thee to repentance,  ran seriously through my thoughts. I\\nwas earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened\\nprovidentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to\\nthese words:  He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance\\nand to give remission.  I threw down the book; and with my heart as\\nwell as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I\\ncried out aloud,  Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince\\nand Saviour! give me repentance!  This was the first time I could say,\\nin the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I\\nprayed with a sense of my condition, and a true Scripture view of hope,\\nfounded on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I\\nmay say, I began to hope that God would hear me.\\n\\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above,  Call on Me, and I\\nwill deliver thee,  in a different sense from what I had ever done\\nbefore; for then I had no notion of anything being called\\n_deliverance_, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for\\nthough I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly\\na prison to me, and that in the worse sense in the world. But now I\\nlearned to take it in another sense: now I looked back upon my past\\nlife with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul\\nsought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore\\ndown all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing. I did not\\nso much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of\\nno consideration in comparison to this. And I add this part here, to\\nhint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense\\nof things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing\\nthan deliverance from affliction.\\n\\nBut, leaving this part, I return to my Journal.\\n\\nMy condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of\\nliving, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by\\na constant reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a\\nhigher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which till now I\\nknew nothing of; also, my health and strength returned, I bestirred\\nmyself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way\\nof living as regular as I could.\\n\\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walking\\nabout with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man\\nthat was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is\\nhardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was\\nreduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and\\nperhaps which had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend\\nit to any to practise, by this experiment: and though it did carry off\\nthe fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent\\nconvulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time. I learned from it\\nalso this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the\\nmost pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those\\nrains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as\\nthe rain which came in the dry season was almost always accompanied\\nwith such storms, so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the\\nrain which fell in September and October.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE\\n\\n\\nI had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All possibility\\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;\\nand I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that\\nplace. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my\\nmind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the\\nisland, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet\\nknew nothing of.\\n\\nIt was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular\\nsurvey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I\\nhinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found after I came about two\\nmiles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no\\nmore than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but\\nthis being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of\\nit at least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be\\nperceived. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs\\nor meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising\\nparts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be\\nsupposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and\\ngrowing to a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other\\nplants, which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might,\\nperhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I\\nsearched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate,\\nmake their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of\\naloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but\\nwild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with\\nthese discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what\\ncourse I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the\\nfruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no\\nconclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was\\nin the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at\\nleast, very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress.\\n\\nThe next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after\\ngoing something further than I had gone the day before, I found the\\nbrook and the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than\\nbefore. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found\\nmelons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.\\nThe vines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of\\ngrapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a\\nsurprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was\\nwarned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when\\nI was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our\\nEnglishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and\\nfevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to\\ncure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins\\nare kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and\\nagreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.\\n\\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from\\nhome. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree,\\nwhere I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery;\\ntravelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the\\nvalley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and\\nnorth side of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening where\\nthe country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh\\nwater, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other\\nway, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so\\nflourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of\\nspring that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on\\nthe side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of\\npleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that\\nthis was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country\\nindefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it,\\nI might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in\\nEngland. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and\\ncitron trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least\\nnot then. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only\\npleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards\\nwith water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.\\nI found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I\\nresolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to\\nfurnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. In\\norder to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a\\nlesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in\\nanother place; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled homewards;\\nresolving to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,\\nto carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in this\\njourney, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but\\nbefore I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit\\nand the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them, they\\nwere good for little or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I\\ncould bring but a few.\\n\\nThe next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two\\nsmall bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming\\nto my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them,\\nto find them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some\\nhere, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded\\nthere were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but\\nwhat they were I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them\\nup on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they\\nwould be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their\\nown weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of\\nthe grapes, and hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they\\nmight cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I\\ncarried as many back as I could well stand under.\\n\\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\\nthe security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and\\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by\\nfar the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider\\nof removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as\\nwhere now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part\\nof the island.\\n\\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for\\nsome time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came\\nto a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside,\\nwhere it was at least possible that something might happen to my\\nadvantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring\\nsome other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce\\nprobable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself\\namong the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate\\nmy bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but\\nimpossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.\\nHowever, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time\\nthere for the whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and\\nthough upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a\\nlittle kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong\\nfence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and\\nfilled between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes\\ntwo or three nights together; always going over it with a ladder; so\\nthat I fancied now I had my country house and my sea-coast house; and\\nthis work took me up to the beginning of August.\\n\\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when\\nthe rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for\\nthough I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and\\nspread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me\\nfrom storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were\\nextraordinary.\\n\\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and\\nbegan to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung\\nup perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the\\nsun; so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy\\nthat I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,\\nand I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two\\nhundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and\\ncarried the most of them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and\\nfrom hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less,\\nevery day till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that\\nI could not stir out of my cave for several days.\\n\\nIn this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I\\nhad been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from\\nme, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her\\ntill, to my astonishment, she came home about the end of August with\\nthree kittens. This was the more strange to me because, though I had\\nkilled a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was\\nquite a different kind from our European cats; but the young cats were\\nthe same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being\\nfemales, I thought it very strange. But from these three cats I\\nafterwards came to be so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill\\nthem like vermin or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as\\nmuch as possible.\\n\\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could\\nnot stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this\\nconfinement, I began to be straitened for food: but venturing out\\ntwice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th,\\nfound a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was\\nregulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of\\nthe goat s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled for, to my\\ngreat misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or\\nthree of the turtle s eggs for my supper.\\n\\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or\\nthree hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards\\none side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or\\nway out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out\\nthis way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had\\nmanaged myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I\\nthought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and\\nyet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the\\nbiggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.\\n\\n_Sept._ 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing. I\\ncast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three\\nhundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting\\nit apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\\nHis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me\\nthrough Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for\\ntwelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a\\nbiscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day\\nas I began it. I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at\\nfirst I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,\\nomitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than\\nordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of\\nthe days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had\\nbeen there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every\\nseventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I\\nhad lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink\\nbegan to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly,\\nand to write down only the most remarkable events of my life, without\\ncontinuing a daily memorandum of other things.\\n\\nThe rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,\\nand I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but\\nI bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to\\nrelate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.\\n\\nI have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice,\\nwhich I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of\\nthemselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and\\nabout twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it,\\nafter the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me.\\nAccordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my\\nwooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as\\nI was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow\\nit all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for\\nit, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of\\neach. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not\\none grain of what I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry\\nmonths following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown,\\nit had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till\\nthe wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but\\nnewly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined\\nwas by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make\\nanother trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and\\nsowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal\\nequinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water\\nit, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having\\npart of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had\\nbut a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half\\na peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of my\\nbusiness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that\\nI might expect two seed-times and two harvests every year.\\n\\nWhile this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use\\nto me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began\\nto settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the\\ncountry to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I\\nfound all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I\\nhad made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut\\nout of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown\\nwith long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first\\nyear after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to call it that\\nthese stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased,\\nto see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow\\nas much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a\\nfigure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a\\ncircle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such\\nI might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade,\\nsufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to\\ncut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle\\nround my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; and\\nplacing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards\\ndistance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a\\nfine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also,\\nas I shall observe in its order.\\n\\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided,\\nnot into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons\\nand the dry seasons, which were generally thus: The half of February,\\nthe whole of March, and the half of April rainy, the sun being then on\\nor near the equinox.\\n\\nThe half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of\\nAugust dry, the sun being then to the north of the line.\\n\\nThe half of August, the whole of September, and the half of\\nOctober rainy, the sun being then come back.\\n\\nThe half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and\\nthe half of February dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.\\n\\nThe rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds\\nhappened to blow, but this was the general observation I made. After I\\nhad found by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the\\nrain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I\\nmight not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as\\npossible during the wet months. This time I found much employment, and\\nvery suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for many\\nthings which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and\\nconstant application; particularly I tried many ways to make myself a\\nbasket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle\\nthat they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now,\\nthat when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a\\nbasket-maker s, in the town where my father lived, to see them make\\ntheir wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to\\nhelp, and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those\\nthings, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full\\nknowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials,\\nwhen it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut\\nmy stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows,\\nand osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day\\nI went to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some of the\\nsmaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire;\\nwhereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a\\nquantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These\\nI set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for\\nuse I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I\\nemployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets,\\nboth to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion;\\nand though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them\\nsufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care\\nnever to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more,\\nespecially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks,\\nwhen I should come to have any quantity of it.\\n\\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,\\nI bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I had\\nno vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which\\nwere almost full of rum, and some glass bottles some of the common\\nsize, and others which were case bottles, square, for the holding of\\nwater, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except\\na great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big\\nfor such as I desired it viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by\\nitself. The second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but\\nit was impossible to me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for\\nthat, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my second rows of\\nstakes or piles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry\\nseason, when another business took me up more time than it could be\\nimagined I could spare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. SURVEYS HIS POSITION\\n\\n\\nI mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and\\nthat I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,\\nand where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the\\nisland. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that\\nside; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity\\nof powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch\\nof raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey. When I had\\npassed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of\\nthe sea to the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried\\nland whether an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very\\nhigh, extending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by\\nmy guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\\n\\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than\\nthat I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my\\nobservations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all\\ninhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been in a worse\\ncondition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the\\ndispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe\\nordered everything for the best; I say I quieted my mind with this, and\\nleft off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.\\n\\nBesides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if this\\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was\\nthe savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are\\nfound the worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and\\nfail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their\\nhands.\\n\\nWith these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I found\\nthat side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine the\\nopen or savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full\\nof very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have\\ncaught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to\\nspeak to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I\\nknocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it\\nhome; but it was some years before I could make him speak; however, at\\nlast I taught him to call me by name very familiarly. But the accident\\nthat followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its\\nplace.\\n\\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low\\ngrounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed\\ngreatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy\\nmyself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be\\nventurous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good\\ntoo, especially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or\\ntortoise, which added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have\\nfurnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and\\nthough my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for\\nthankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had\\nrather plenty, even to dainties.\\n\\nI never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or\\nthereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see what\\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I\\nresolved to sit down all night; and then I either reposed myself in a\\ntree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the\\nground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature\\ncould come at me without waking me.\\n\\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had\\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the\\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I\\nhad found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite\\nnumber of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I\\nhad not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I\\nknew not the names of, except those called penguins.\\n\\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my\\npowder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat if I\\ncould, which I could better feed on; and though there were many goats\\nhere, more than on my side the island, yet it was with much more\\ndifficulty that I could come near them, the country being flat and\\neven, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.\\n\\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but\\nyet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my\\nhabitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was\\nhere to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I\\ntravelled along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about\\ntwelve miles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a\\nmark, I concluded I would go home again, and that the next journey I\\ntook should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling,\\nand so round till I came to my post again.\\n\\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could\\neasily keep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss\\nfinding my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself\\nmistaken, for being come about two or three miles, I found myself\\ndescended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and\\nthose hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my way by\\nany direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very\\nwell the position of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to\\nmy further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four\\ndays while I was in the valley, and not being able to see the sun, I\\nwandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find the\\nseaside, look for my post, and come back the same way I went: and then,\\nby easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot,\\nand my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.\\n\\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and\\nI, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from\\nthe dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had\\noften been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two,\\nand so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my\\npowder and shot should be all spent. I made a collar for this little\\ncreature, and with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which I\\nalways carried about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty,\\ntill I came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I\\nwas very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above a\\nmonth.\\n\\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey,\\nwithout settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my\\nown house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me\\ncompared to that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable,\\nthat I resolved I would never go a great way from it again while it\\nshould be my lot to stay on the island.\\n\\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\\njourney; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty\\naffair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere\\ndomestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of\\nthe poor kid which I had penned in within my little circle, and\\nresolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I\\nwent, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,\\nbut was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of\\ntrees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over,\\nand having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it\\nwas so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for\\nit followed me like a dog: and as I continually fed it, the creature\\nbecame so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time\\none of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.\\n\\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the\\n30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the\\nanniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there two\\nyears, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I\\ncame there, I spent the whole day in humble and thankful\\nacknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary\\ncondition was attended with, and without which it might have been\\ninfinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God had\\nbeen pleased to discover to me that it was possible I might be more\\nhappy in this solitary condition than I should have been in the liberty\\nof society, and in all the pleasures of the world; that He could fully\\nmake up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of\\nhuman society, by His presence and the communications of His grace to\\nmy soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon His\\nprovidence here, and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.\\n\\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life\\nI now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,\\ncursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days; and now I\\nchanged both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my\\naffections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from\\nwhat they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.\\n\\nBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing the\\ncountry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me\\non a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the\\nwoods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner,\\nlocked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an\\nuninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the\\ngreatest composure of my mind, this would break out upon me like a\\nstorm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a child. Sometimes it\\nwould take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit\\ndown and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two together;\\nand this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or\\nvent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted\\nitself, would abate.\\n\\nBut now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the\\nword of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.\\nOne morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words,  I\\nwill never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  Immediately it\\noccurred that these words were to me; why else should they be directed\\nin such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my\\ncondition, as one forsaken of God and man?  Well, then,  said I,  if\\nGod does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what\\nmatters it, though the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other\\nhand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and blessing\\nof God, there would be no comparison in the loss? \\n\\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible\\nfor me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it\\nwas probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in\\nthe world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for\\nbringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but something\\nshocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.  How\\ncanst thou become such a hypocrite,  said I, even audibly,  to pretend\\nto be thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to\\nbe contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered\\nfrom?  So I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God for\\nbeing there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by\\nwhatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my\\nlife, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the\\nBible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing\\nmy friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my\\ngoods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of\\nthe ship.\\n\\nThus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and\\nthough I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an\\naccount of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be\\nobserved that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my\\ntime according to the several daily employments that were before me,\\nsuch as: first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I\\nconstantly set apart some time for thrice every day; secondly, the\\ngoing abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three\\nhours in every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering,\\ncutting, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught for my\\nsupply; these took up great part of the day. Also, it is to be\\nconsidered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the\\nzenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that\\nabout four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to\\nwork in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of\\nhunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with\\nmy gun in the afternoon.\\n\\nTo this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the\\nexceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of\\ntools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of\\nmy time. For example, I was full two and forty days in making a board\\nfor a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with\\ntheir tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same\\ntree in half a day.\\n\\nMy case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down,\\nbecause my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days in\\ncutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a\\nlog or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduced\\nboth the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to\\nmove; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a\\nboard from end to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other\\nside til I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth\\non both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece\\nof work; but labour and patience carried me through that, and many\\nother things. I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why\\nso much of my time went away with so little work viz. that what might\\nbe a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and\\nrequired a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But\\nnotwithstanding this, with patience and labour I got through everything\\nthat my circumstances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by\\nwhat follows.\\n\\nI was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\\nbarley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not\\ngreat; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity\\nof half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry\\nseason. But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I\\nwas in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which\\nit was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and\\nwild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the\\nblade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so\\nclose, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.\\n\\nThis I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a\\nhedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it\\nrequired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my\\ncrop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks  time; and\\nshooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it\\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen\\napace.\\n\\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so\\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for,\\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\\nsurrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it\\nwere, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them,\\nfor I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose\\nup a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the\\ncorn itself.\\n\\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would\\ndevour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be able to\\nraise a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell; however, I\\nresolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it\\nnight and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what damage\\nwas already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but\\nthat as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great but\\nthat the remainder was likely to be a good crop if it could be saved.\\n\\nI stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see\\nthe thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited\\ntill I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked\\noff, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they\\ndropped down one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I\\ncould not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every\\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in\\nthe consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed\\nthree of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and\\nserved them as we serve notorious thieves in England hanged them in\\nchains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that this\\nshould have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not\\ncome at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the\\nisland, and I could never see a bird near the place as long as my\\nscarecrows hung there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and\\nabout the latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the\\nyear, I reaped my corn.\\n\\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I\\ncould do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the\\nbroadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the\\nship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great\\ndifficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut\\nnothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I\\nhad made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my\\nharvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed I had near two\\nbushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley; that is to\\nsay, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time.\\n\\nHowever, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in\\ntime, it would please God to supply me with bread. And yet here I was\\nperplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my\\ncorn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal,\\nhow to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to\\nbake it. These things being added to my desire of having a good\\nquantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to\\ntaste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next\\nseason; and in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working\\nto accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.\\n\\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I believe few\\npeople have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things\\nnecessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and\\nfinishing this one article of bread.\\n\\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily\\ndiscouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after\\nI had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came\\nup unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.\\n\\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth no spade or shovel to dig\\nit. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed\\nbefore; but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost\\nme a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only\\nwore out soon, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed\\nmuch worse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out\\nwith patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the\\ncorn was sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself,\\nand drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it\\nmay be called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was growing, and\\ngrown, I have observed already how many things I wanted to fence it,\\nsecure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from\\nthe chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to\\ndress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it;\\nbut all these things I did without, as shall be observed; and yet the\\ncorn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I\\nsaid, made everything laborious and tedious to me; but that there was\\nno help for. Neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I had\\ndivided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to these\\nworks; and as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I\\nhad a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself\\nwholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper\\nfor the performing all the operations necessary for making the corn,\\nwhen I had it, fit for my use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. A BOAT\\n\\n\\nBut first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow\\nabove an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week s work at\\nleast to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one\\nindeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to work with it.\\nHowever, I got through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces\\nof ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced\\nthem in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that\\nwood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in a\\nyear s time, I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would\\nwant but little repair. This work did not take me up less than three\\nmonths, because a great part of that time was the wet season, when I\\ncould not go abroad. Within-doors, that is when it rained and I could\\nnot go out, I found employment in the following occupations always\\nobserving, that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with\\ntalking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught\\nhim to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud,\\n Poll,  which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by\\nany mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an\\nassistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment\\nupon my hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some means or\\nother, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew\\nnot where to come at them. However, considering the heat of the\\nclimate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make\\nsome pots that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong\\nenough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and\\nrequired to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the preparing\\ncorn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make\\nsome as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what\\nshould be put into them.\\n\\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how\\nmany awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly\\nthings I made; how many of them fell in and how many fell out, the clay\\nnot being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the\\nover-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many\\nfell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were\\ndried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the\\nclay to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it I could not\\nmake above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in\\nabout two months  labour.\\n\\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them\\nvery gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets,\\nwhich I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as\\nbetween the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I\\nstuffed it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being\\nto stand always dry I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the\\nmeal, when the corn was bruised.\\n\\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made\\nseveral smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,\\nflat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to;\\nand the heat of the sun baked them quite hard.\\n\\nBut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot\\nto hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could\\ndo. It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking\\nmy meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a\\nbroken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as\\nhard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see\\nit, and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn\\nwhole, if they would burn broken.\\n\\nThis set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some\\npots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of\\nglazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I\\nplaced three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon\\nanother, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of\\nembers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside\\nand upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite\\nthrough, and observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw them\\nclear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till\\nI found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the\\nsand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,\\nand would have run into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire\\ngradually till the pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching\\nthem all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the\\nmorning I had three very good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and\\ntwo other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of\\nthem perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.\\n\\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of\\nearthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of them,\\nthey were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way\\nof making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would\\nmake pies that never learned to raise paste.\\n\\nNo joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I\\nfound I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had\\nhardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set one on the\\nfire again with some water in it to boil me some meat, which it did\\nadmirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,\\nthough I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to\\nmake it as good as I would have had it been.\\n\\nMy next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn\\nin; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that\\nperfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was at\\na great loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly\\nunqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any\\ntools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone\\nbig enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find\\nnone at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way\\nto dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness\\nsufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither\\nwould bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn\\nwithout filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in\\nsearching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a\\ngreat block of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and\\ngetting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed\\nit on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of\\nfire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in\\nBrazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or\\nbeater of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid\\nby against I had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to\\ngrind, or rather pound into meal to make bread.\\n\\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my meal, and\\nto part it from the bran and the husk; without which I did not see it\\npossible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing even\\nto think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to\\nmake it I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through.\\nAnd here I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know\\nwhat to do. Linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat s\\nhair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how,\\nhere were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for\\nthis was, that at last I did remember I had, among the seamen s clothes\\nwhich were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;\\nand with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough\\nfor the work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did\\nafterwards, I shall show in its place.\\n\\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\\nmake bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no yeast. As to\\nthat part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself\\nmuch about it. But for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At length I\\nfound out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some\\nearthen-vessels very broad but not deep, that is to say, about two feet\\ndiameter, and not above nine inches deep. These I burned in the fire,\\nas I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I\\nmade a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square\\ntiles of my own baking and burning also; but I should not call them\\nsquare.\\n\\nWhen the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals, I\\ndrew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and\\nthere I let them lie till the hearth was very hot. Then sweeping away\\nall the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the\\nearthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the\\npot, to keep in and add to the heat; and thus as well as in the best\\noven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became in little time\\na good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and\\npuddings of the rice; but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put\\ninto them supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.\\n\\nIt need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of\\nthe third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed that in the\\nintervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;\\nfor I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I\\ncould, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time\\nto rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to\\nthrash it with.\\n\\nAnd now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build\\nmy barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of\\nthe corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\\nbushels, and of the rice as much or more; insomuch that now I resolved\\nto begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great\\nwhile; also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me\\na whole year, and to sow but once a year.\\n\\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were\\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.\\n\\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other\\nside of the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on\\nshore there, fancying that, seeing the mainland, and an inhabited\\ncountry, I might find some way or other to convey myself further, and\\nperhaps at last find some means of escape.\\n\\nBut all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an\\nundertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and\\nperhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions\\nand tigers of Africa: that if I once came in their power, I should run\\na hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of\\nbeing eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast\\nwere cannibals or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could\\nnot be far from that shore. Then, supposing they were not cannibals,\\nyet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their\\nhands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty\\ntogether much more I, that was but one, and could make little or no\\ndefence; all these things, I say, which I ought to have considered\\nwell; and did come into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave me no\\napprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the thought of\\ngetting over to the shore.\\n\\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton\\nsail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of\\nAfrica; but this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our\\nship s boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great\\nway, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where\\nshe did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the\\nwaves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of\\nbeachy, rough sand, but no water about her. If I had had hands to have\\nrefitted her, and to have launched her into the water, the boat would\\nhave done well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with\\nher easily enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn\\nher and set her upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island;\\nhowever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought\\nthem to the boat resolving to try what I could do; suggesting to myself\\nthat if I could but turn her down, I might repair the damage she had\\nreceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in\\nher very easily.\\n\\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,\\nI think, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to\\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,\\nto undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to\\nthrust and guide it right in the fall.\\n\\nBut when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get\\nunder it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was\\nforced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the\\nboat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than\\ndecreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.\\n\\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make\\nmyself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates\\nmake, even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the\\ntrunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and\\npleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my\\nhaving much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians;\\nbut not at all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay\\nunder more than the Indians did viz. want of hands to move it, when it\\nwas made, into the water a difficulty much harder for me to surmount\\nthan all the consequences of want of tools could be to them; for what\\nwas it to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with\\nmuch trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew and\\ndub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out\\nthe inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it if, after all\\nthis, I must leave it just there where I found it, and not be able to\\nlaunch it into the water?\\n\\nOne would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon\\nmy mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should\\nhave immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my\\nthoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never\\nonce considered how I should get it off the land: and it was really, in\\nits own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of\\nsea than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it\\nafloat in the water.\\n\\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did\\nwho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,\\nwithout determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but\\nthat the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I\\nput a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave\\nmyself Let me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other\\nto get it along when it is done. \\n\\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\\nprevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and I question\\nmuch whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\\nof Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part\\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of\\ntwenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted\\ninto branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this\\ntree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was\\nfourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading\\nhead cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet,\\nand inexpressible labour; after this, it cost me a month to shape it\\nand dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,\\nthat it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three\\nmonths more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact\\nboat of it; this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and\\nchisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a\\nvery handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty\\nmen, and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.\\n\\nWhen I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with it.\\nThe boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua,\\nthat was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost,\\nyou may be sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no\\nquestion, but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most\\nunlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.\\n\\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost\\nme infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,\\nand not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards\\nthe creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig\\ninto the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began,\\nand it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains who\\nhave their deliverance in view?); but when this was worked through, and\\nthis difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no\\nmore stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the\\ndistance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the\\nwater up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the\\nwater. Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and\\ncalculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be\\nthrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but\\nmy own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone\\nthrough with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it\\nmust have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with\\ngreat reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.\\n\\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly\\nof our own strength to go through with it.\\n\\nIn the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and\\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\\never before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the\\nWord of God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different\\nknowledge from what I had before. I entertained different notions of\\nthings. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had\\nnothing to do with, no expectations from, and, indeed, no desires\\nabout: in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever\\nlikely to have, so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it\\nhereafter viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and\\nwell might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives,  Between me and thee is a\\ngreat gulf fixed. \\n\\nIn the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world\\nhere; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor\\nthe pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now\\ncapable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I\\nmight call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had\\npossession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to\\ndispute sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised\\nship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow\\nas I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough,\\nbut now and then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had\\ntimber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough\\nto have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that\\nfleet when it had been built.\\n\\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to\\neat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed\\nmore flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed\\nmore corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut\\ndown were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them\\nbut for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.\\n\\nIn a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon\\njust reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther\\ngood to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up\\nto give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The\\nmost covetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the\\nvice of covetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed\\ninfinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,\\nexcept it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles,\\nthough, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel\\nof money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.\\nAlas! there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no more manner of\\nbusiness for it; and often thought with myself that I would have given\\na handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to\\ngrind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for a sixpenny-worth of\\nturnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and\\nbeans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by\\nit or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy\\nwith the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the\\ndrawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case they had been of no\\nmanner of value to me, because of no use.\\n\\nI had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it\\nwas at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I\\nfrequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of\\nGod s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I\\nlearned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less\\nupon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I\\nwanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot\\nexpress them; and which I take notice of here, to put those\\ndiscontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what\\nGod has given them, because they see and covet something that He has\\nnot given them. All our discontents about what we want appeared to me\\nto spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.\\n\\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,\\nto compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would\\nbe; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence\\nof God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the\\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got\\nout of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I\\nhad wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and\\nshot for getting my food.\\n\\nI spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,\\nin the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing\\nout of the ship. How I could not have so much as got any food, except\\nfish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them,\\nI must have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not\\nperished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by\\nany contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh\\nfrom the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my\\nteeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.\\n\\nThese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence\\nto me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its\\nhardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend to\\nthe reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say,  Is any\\naffliction like mine?  Let them consider how much worse the cases of\\nsome people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had\\nthought fit.\\n\\nI had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind\\nwith hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had\\ndeserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of\\nProvidence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the\\nknowledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed by father and\\nmother; neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours\\nto infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and\\nwhat the nature and end of my being required of me. But, alas! falling\\nearly into the seafaring life, which of all lives is the most destitute\\nof the fear of God, though His terrors are always before them; I say,\\nfalling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all\\nthat little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out\\nof me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the\\nviews of death, which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all\\nmanner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was like\\nmyself, or to hear anything that was good or tended towards it.\\n\\nSo void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of what I\\nwas, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed such as\\nmy escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of\\nthe ship; my being planted so well in the Brazils; my receiving the\\ncargo from England, and the like I never had once the words  Thank\\nGod!  so much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest\\ndistress had I so much as a thought to pray to Him, or so much as to\\nsay,  Lord, have mercy upon me!  no, nor to mention the name of God,\\nunless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.\\n\\nI had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have\\nalready observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and\\nwhen I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had\\nattended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt\\nbountifully with me had not only punished me less than my iniquity had\\ndeserved, but had so plentifully provided for me this gave me great\\nhopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in\\nstore for me.\\n\\nWith these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation\\nto the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but\\neven to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was\\nyet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due\\npunishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no\\nreason to have expected in that place; that I ought never more to\\nrepine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for\\nthat daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have\\nbrought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle,\\neven as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long\\nseries of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a place in the\\nuninhabitable part of the world where I could have been cast more to my\\nadvantage; a place where, as I had no society, which was my affliction\\non one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or\\ntigers, to threaten my life; no venomous creatures, or poisons, which I\\nmight feed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me. In a\\nword, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of\\nmercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to\\nbe able to make my sense of God s goodness to me, and care over me in\\nthis condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a just\\nimprovement on these things, I went away, and was no more sad. I had\\nnow been here so long that many things which I had brought on shore for\\nmy help were either quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent.\\n\\nMy ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,\\nwhich I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so\\npale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as\\nit lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on\\nwhich any remarkable thing happened to me; and first, by casting up\\ntimes past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days\\nin the various providences which befell me, and which, if I had been\\nsuperstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might\\nhave had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.\\n\\nFirst, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from my\\nfather and friends and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the\\nsame day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a\\nslave; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that\\nship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape\\nfrom Sallee in a boat; the same day of the year I was born on viz. the\\n30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved\\ntwenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island; so\\nthat my wicked life and my solitary life began both on a day.\\n\\nThe next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread I mean the\\nbiscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the\\nlast degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a-day for above a\\nyear; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got\\nany corn of my own, and great reason I had to be thankful that I had\\nany at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to\\nmiraculous.\\n\\nMy clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a good\\nwhile, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the\\nother seamen, and which I carefully preserved; because many times I\\ncould bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great\\nhelp to me that I had, among all the men s clothes of the ship, almost\\nthree dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick\\nwatch-coats of the seamen s which were left, but they were too hot to\\nwear; and though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that\\nthere was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked no, though\\nI had been inclined to it, which I was not nor could I abide the\\nthought of it, though I was alone. The reason why I could not go naked\\nwas, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as\\nwith some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin:\\nwhereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and\\nwhistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more\\ncould I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a\\ncap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating with such violence as it\\ndoes in that place, would give me the headache presently, by darting so\\ndirectly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear\\nit; whereas, if I put on my hat it would presently go away.\\n\\nUpon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,\\nwhich I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the\\nwaistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make\\njackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such\\nother materials as I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or rather,\\nindeed, botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made\\nshift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me\\na great while: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry\\nshift indeed till afterwards.\\n\\nI have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I\\nkilled, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up, stretched out\\nwith sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and\\nhard that they were fit for little, but others were very useful. The\\nfirst thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair\\non the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well,\\nthat after I made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins that is to\\nsay, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for\\nthey were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must\\nnot omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a\\nbad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I made\\nvery good shift with, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the\\nhair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.\\n\\nAfter this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella;\\nI was, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one;\\nI had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the\\ngreat heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and\\ngreater too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be\\nmuch abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as\\nthe heats. I took a world of pains with it, and was a great while\\nbefore I could make anything likely to hold: nay, after I had thought I\\nhad hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind:\\nbut at last I made one that answered indifferently well: the main\\ndifficulty I found was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but\\nif it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any\\nway but just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I\\nsaid, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair\\nupwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept off\\nthe sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the\\nweather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest, and\\nwhen I had no need of it could close it, and carry it under my arm.\\n\\nThus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by\\nresigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon\\nthe disposal of His providence. This made my life better than sociable,\\nfor when I began to regret the want of conversation I would ask myself,\\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I\\nmay say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than\\nthe utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. TAMES GOATS\\n\\n\\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\\nhappened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\\nand place, as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my\\nyearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of\\nboth which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one\\nyear s provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my\\ndaily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a\\ncanoe, which at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of\\nsix feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost\\nhalf a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it\\nwithout considering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should\\nbe able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water,\\nor bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was as a\\nmemorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next\\ntime, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place\\nwhere I could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I\\nhave said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last,\\nI never gave it over; and though I was near two years about it, yet I\\nnever grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at\\nlast.\\n\\nHowever, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was\\nnot at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the\\nfirst; I mean of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was\\nabove forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted\\nto put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had\\na boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I\\nhad been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already\\ndescribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little\\njourney made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I\\nhad a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.\\n\\nFor this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and\\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail\\ntoo out of some of the pieces of the ship s sails which lay in store,\\nand of which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail,\\nand tried the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made\\nlittle lockers or boxes at each end of my boat, to put provisions,\\nnecessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or\\nthe spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the\\ninside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang\\ndown over it to keep it dry.\\n\\nI fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast, to\\nstand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an\\nawning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the\\nsea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At last,\\nbeing eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved\\nupon my cruise; and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage,\\nputting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should call them) of\\nbarley-bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a good\\ndeal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for\\nkilling more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned\\nbefore, I had saved out of the seamen s chests; these I took, one to\\nlie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.\\n\\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign or my\\ncaptivity, which you please that I set out on this voyage, and I found\\nit much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not\\nvery large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great\\nledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above\\nwater, some under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a\\nleague more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to\\ndouble the point.\\n\\nWhen I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,\\nand come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out\\nto sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came\\nto an anchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a\\nbroken grappling which I got out of the ship.\\n\\nHaving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a\\nhill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent\\nof it, and resolved to venture.\\n\\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a\\nstrong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and\\neven came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it because\\nI saw there might be some danger that when I came into it I might be\\ncarried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the\\nisland again; and indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe\\nit would have been so; for there was the same current on the other side\\nthe island, only that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there\\nwas a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get\\nout of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.\\n\\nI lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at\\nESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach\\nof the sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for me to keep too\\nclose to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of\\nthe stream.\\n\\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the\\nsea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and\\nignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not\\neven my boat s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great\\ndepth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my\\nboat along with it with such violence that all I could do could not\\nkeep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me\\nfarther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. There\\nwas no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my paddles\\nsignified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost; for as\\nthe current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues\\ndistance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor\\ndid I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect\\nbefore me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough,\\nbut of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the\\nshore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat;\\nand I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen\\npots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,\\nto be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand\\nleagues at least?\\n\\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even\\nthe most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon\\nmy desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world\\nand all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there\\nagain. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes O happy\\ndesert!  said I,  I shall never see thee more. O miserable creature!\\nwhither am going?  Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper,\\nand that I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I\\ngive to be on shore there again! Thus, we never see the true state of\\nour condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know\\nhow to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarcely\\npossible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from\\nmy beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide\\nocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering\\nit again. However, I worked hard till, indeed, my strength was almost\\nexhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards\\nthe side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could;\\nwhen about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a\\nlittle breeze of wind in my face, springing up from SSE. This cheered\\nmy heart a little, and especially when, in about half-an-hour more, it\\nblew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I had got at a frightful\\ndistance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather\\nintervened, I had been undone another way, too; for I had no compass on\\nboard, and should never have known how to have steered towards the\\nisland, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather continuing\\nclear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail,\\nstanding away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the\\ncurrent.\\n\\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,\\nI saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current\\nwas near; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but\\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I\\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\\nrocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the\\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made\\na strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very\\nsharp stream.\\n\\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who\\nhave been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of\\njoy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and\\nthe wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running\\ncheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot.\\n\\nThis eddy carried me about a league on my way back again, directly\\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than\\nthe current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near\\nthe island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to\\nsay, the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out\\nfrom.\\n\\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this\\ncurrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further.\\nHowever, I found that being between two great currents viz. that on the\\nsouth side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay\\nabout a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake\\nof the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way;\\nand having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering\\ndirectly for the island, though not making such fresh way as I did\\nbefore.\\n\\nAbout four o clock in the evening, being then within a league of the\\nisland, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster\\nstretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting\\noff the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to\\nthe north; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the\\nway my course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However,\\nhaving a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west;\\nand in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it\\nbeing smooth water, I soon got to land.\\n\\nWhen I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks for my\\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by\\nmy boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my\\nboat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some\\ntrees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and\\nfatigue of the voyage.\\n\\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat! I had run\\nso much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting\\nit by the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean\\nthe west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures;\\nso I resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the\\nshore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate\\nin safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three\\nmiles or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet\\nor bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little\\nrivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat,\\nand where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose\\nfor her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on\\nshore to look about me, and see where I was.\\n\\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out\\nof my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began\\nmy march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had\\nbeen upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found\\neverything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,\\nbeing, as I said before, my country house.\\n\\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs,\\nfor I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that\\nread my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my\\nsleep by a voice calling me by my name several times,  Robin, Robin,\\nRobin Crusoe: poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are\\nyou? Where have you been? \\n\\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or part of\\nthe day, and with walking the latter part, that I did not wake\\nthoroughly; but dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but\\nas the voice continued to repeat,  Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,  at last\\nI began to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened,\\nand started up in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes\\nopen, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and\\nimmediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such\\nbemoaning language I had used to talk to him and teach him; and he had\\nlearned it so perfectly that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his\\nbill close to my face and cry,  Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where\\nhave you been? How came you here?  and such things as I had taught him.\\n\\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could\\nbe nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.\\nFirst, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he\\nshould just keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well\\nsatisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and\\nholding out my hand, and calling him by his name,  Poll,  the sociable\\ncreature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and\\ncontinued talking to me,  Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here?\\nand where had I been?  just as if he had been overjoyed to see me\\nagain; and so I carried him home along with me.\\n\\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough\\nto do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been\\nin. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of\\nthe island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As\\nto the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well\\nenough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and\\nmy very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side\\nof the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the\\ncurrent ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it\\npassed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being driven\\ndown the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of\\nbeing carried away from it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself\\nto be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many\\nmonths  labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.\\n\\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year; and lived a\\nvery sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts\\nbeing very much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in\\nresigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived\\nreally very happily in all things except that of society.\\n\\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should,\\nupon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering\\nhow few tools I had.\\n\\nBesides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,\\nand contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found\\ninfinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shaped,\\nwhich before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was\\nnever more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I\\nfound out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it\\nwas a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red,\\nlike other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the\\nsmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used\\nto smoke; and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first,\\nnot thinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I\\nsearched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes.\\n\\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome,\\nyet they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things\\nup in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad,\\nI could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces,\\nand bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it\\nup, take out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough\\nfor me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.\\nAlso, large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I always\\nrubbed out as soon as it was dry and cured, and kept it in great\\nbaskets.\\n\\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want\\nwhich it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\\nsay, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is observed in the third\\nyear of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I\\nwas in hopes of getting a he-goat; but I could not by any means bring\\nit to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in\\nmy heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.\\n\\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have\\nsaid, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap\\nand snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them\\nalive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young. For this\\npurpose I made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more\\nthan once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,\\nand I always found them broken and my bait devoured. At length I\\nresolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in\\nplaces where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits\\nI placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great weight upon them;\\nand several times I put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the\\ntrap; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten\\nup the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set\\nthree traps in one night, and going the next morning I found them, all\\nstanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.\\nHowever, I altered my traps; and not to trouble you with particulars,\\ngoing one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large old\\nhe-goat; and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.\\n\\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce I\\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away\\nalive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was\\nnot my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and\\nhe ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I did not\\nthen know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion. If I\\nhad let him stay three or four days without food, and then have carried\\nhim some water to drink and then a little corn, he would have been as\\ntame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable\\ncreatures, where they are well used.\\n\\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:\\nthen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\\n\\nIt was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some\\nsweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found\\nthat if I expected to supply myself with goats  flesh, when I had no\\npowder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when,\\nperhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But\\nthen it occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else\\nthey would always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this\\nwas to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with\\nhedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those within might\\nnot break out, or those without break in.\\n\\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw there\\nwas an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a\\nproper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them\\nto eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\\n\\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\\ncontrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these\\n(being a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people\\ncall it in the western colonies), which had two or three little drills\\nof fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody I say, they will\\nsmile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this\\npiece of ground in such a manner that, my hedge or pale must have been\\nat least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the\\ncompass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough\\nto do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in\\nso much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have\\nso much room to chase them in that I should never catch them.\\n\\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when\\nthis thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the\\nbeginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty\\nyards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would\\nmaintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my\\nstock increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.\\n\\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I\\nwas about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done\\nit, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to\\nfeed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I\\nwould go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and\\nfeed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished and I\\nlet them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for\\na handful of corn.\\n\\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of\\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had\\nthree-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food.\\nAfter that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,\\nwith little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted, and gates out\\nof one piece of ground into another.\\n\\nBut this was not all; for now I not only had goat s flesh to feed on\\nwhen I pleased, but milk too a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I\\ndid not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,\\nwas really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had\\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives\\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\\nbutter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays\\nand miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also salt\\n(though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon\\nsome of the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How\\nmercifully can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those\\nconditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How\\ncan He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise\\nHim for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here spread for me in\\nthe wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. FINDS PRINT OF MAN S FOOT ON THE SAND\\n\\n\\nIt would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family\\nsit down to dinner. There was my majesty the prince and lord of the\\nwhole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute\\ncommand; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no\\nrebels among all my subjects. Then, to see how like a king I dined,\\ntoo, all alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my\\nfavourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was\\nnow grown old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind\\nupon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the\\ntable and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,\\nas a mark of especial favour.\\n\\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for\\nthey were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation\\nby my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what\\nkind of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas\\nthe rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at\\nlast, for they would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till\\nat last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at\\nlength they left me. With this attendance and in this plentiful manner\\nI lived; neither could I be said to want anything but society; and of\\nthat, some time after this, I was likely to have too much.\\n\\nI was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my\\nboat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore\\nsometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at\\nother times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I had a\\nstrange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island\\nwhere, as I have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how\\nthe shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to\\ndo: this inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I\\nresolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I\\ndid so; but had any one in England met such a man as I was, it must\\neither have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as\\nI frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at\\nthe notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,\\nand in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as\\nfollows.\\n\\nI had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat s skin, with a flap\\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the\\nrain off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these\\nclimates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.\\n\\nI had a short jacket of goat s skin, the skirts coming down to about\\nthe middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the\\nsame; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair\\nhung down such a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it\\nreached to the middle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but\\nhad made me a pair of somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, like\\nbuskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like\\nspatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the\\nrest of my clothes.\\n\\nI had on a broad belt of goat s skin dried, which I drew together with\\ntwo thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on\\neither side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw\\nand a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other. I had another belt\\nnot so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my\\nshoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,\\nboth made of goat s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the\\nother my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my\\ngun, and over my head a great clumsy, ugly, goat s-skin umbrella, but\\nwhich, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me next to\\nmy gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like\\nas one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living\\nwithin nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered\\nto grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both\\nscissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what\\ngrew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of\\nMahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee,\\nfor the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these\\nmoustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang\\nmy hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough,\\nand such as in England would have passed for frightful.\\n\\nBut all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to\\nobserve me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of\\nthat. In this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or\\nsix days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place\\nwhere I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and\\nhaving no boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way\\nto the same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the\\npoints of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double\\nwith my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all\\nsmooth and quiet no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there\\nthan in other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and\\nresolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from\\nthe sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced\\nhow it was viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining\\nwith the current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be\\nthe occasion of this current, and that, according as the wind blew more\\nforcibly from the west or from the north, this current came nearer or\\nwent farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I\\nwent up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I\\nplainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther off,\\nbeing near half a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set\\nclose upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which\\nat another time it would not have done.\\n\\nThis observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe\\nthe ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring\\nmy boat about the island again; but when I began to think of putting it\\nin practice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of\\nthe danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any\\npatience, but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was\\nmore safe, though more laborious and this was, that I would build, or\\nrather make, me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side\\nof the island, and one for the other.\\n\\nYou are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\\nin the island one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about\\nit, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had\\nenlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. One of\\nthese, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my\\nwall or fortification that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to\\nthe rock was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have\\ngiven an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which\\nwould hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of\\nprovisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the\\nstraw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.\\n\\nAs for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one s view,\\nof any habitation behind them.\\n\\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly\\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\\nseason; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\\nadjoining as fit as that.\\n\\nBesides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable\\nplantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called\\nit, which I kept in repair that is to say, I kept the hedge which\\nencircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder\\nstanding always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no\\nmore than stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so\\nthat they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more\\nagreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle\\nof this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread\\nover poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair\\nor renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch with the\\nskins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a\\nblanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had\\nsaved; and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had\\noccasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country\\nhabitation.\\n\\nAdjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say my\\ngoats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\\nenclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the\\ngoats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite\\nlabour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,\\nand so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and\\nthere was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which\\nafterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy\\nseason, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any\\nwall.\\n\\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no\\npains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable\\nsupport, for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus\\nat my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and\\ncheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty\\nyears; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my\\nperfecting my enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of\\nkeeping them together; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually\\nsecured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted\\nthem so very thick that I was forced to pull some of them up again.\\n\\nIn this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally\\ndepended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to\\npreserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my\\nwhole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal,\\nwholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\\n\\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the\\nplace where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in\\nmy way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all\\nthings about or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes I went\\nout in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,\\nscarcely ever above a stone s cast or two from the shore, I was so\\napprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents\\nor winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my\\nlife.\\n\\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was\\nexceedingly surprised with the print of a man s naked foot on the\\nshore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one\\nthunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked\\nround me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a\\nrising ground to look farther; I went up the shore and down the shore,\\nbut it was all one; I could see no other impression but that one. I\\nwent to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it\\nmight not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was\\nexactly the print of a foot toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How\\nit came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but after\\ninnumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out\\nof myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the\\nground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me\\nat every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and\\nfancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to\\ndescribe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented\\nthings to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my\\nfancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts\\nby the way.\\n\\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this),\\nI fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as\\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called\\na door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning,\\nfor never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more\\nterror of mind than I to this retreat.\\n\\nI slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my\\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary\\nto the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of\\nall creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful\\nideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to\\nmyself, even though I was now a great way off. Sometimes I fancied it\\nmust be the devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition,\\nfor how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?\\nWhere was the vessel that brought them? What marks were there of any\\nother footstep? And how was it possible a man should come there? But\\nthen, to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a\\nplace, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave\\nthe print of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for\\nhe could not be sure I should see it this was an amusement the other\\nway. I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of\\nother ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a\\nfoot; that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would\\nnever have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was\\nten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the\\nsand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would\\nhave defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing\\nitself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of\\nthe devil.\\n\\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\\napprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then\\nthat it must be some more dangerous creature viz. that it must be some\\nof the savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in\\ntheir canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds,\\nhad made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to\\nsea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as\\nI would have been to have had them.\\n\\nWhile these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in\\nmy thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,\\nor that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded\\nthat some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched\\nfarther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about\\ntheir having found out my boat, and that there were people here; and\\nthat, if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers\\nand devour me; that if it should happen that they should not find me,\\nyet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away\\nall my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\\n\\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence\\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had\\nof His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not\\npreserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His\\ngoodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any\\nmore corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if\\nno accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was\\nupon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved\\nfor the future to have two or three years  corn beforehand; so that,\\nwhatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.\\n\\nHow strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by\\nwhat secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as\\ndifferent circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate;\\nto-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow\\nwe fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was\\nexemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable;\\nfor I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from human\\nsociety, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut\\noff from mankind, and condemned to what I call silent life; that I was\\nas one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living,\\nor to appear among the rest of His creatures; that to have seen one of\\nmy own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life,\\nand the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme\\nblessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble\\nat the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into\\nthe ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set\\nhis foot in the island.\\n\\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\\nsurprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely\\nwise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could\\nnot foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I\\nwas not to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an\\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\\nHe thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had\\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought\\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because\\nI had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not\\nonly righteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and\\nafflict me, so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit\\nto do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and\\nentirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to\\nhope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and\\ndirections of His daily providence.\\n\\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and\\nmonths: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I\\ncannot omit. One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with\\nthoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it\\ndiscomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came\\ninto my thoughts,  Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will\\ndeliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.  Upon this, rising cheerfully\\nout of my bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and\\nencouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done\\npraying I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words\\nthat presented to me were,  Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and\\nHe shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.  It is\\nimpossible to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully\\nlaid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.\\n\\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\\ncame into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of\\nmy own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I\\ncame on shore from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I\\nbegan to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing\\nelse but my own foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat,\\nas well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also\\nthat I could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I\\nhad not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot,\\nI had played the part of those fools who try to make stories of\\nspectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than\\nanybody.\\n\\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\\nstarve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but\\nsome barley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be\\nmilked too, which usually was my evening diversion: and the poor\\ncreatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and,\\nindeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.\\nEncouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing\\nbut the print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to\\nstart at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my\\ncountry house to milk my flock: but to see with what fear I went\\nforward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now and\\nthen to lay down my basket and run for my life, it would have made any\\none have thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had\\nbeen lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I\\nwent down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I began to\\nbe a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it but my\\nown imagination; but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I\\nshould go down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and\\nmeasure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness,\\nthat I might be assured it was my own foot: but when I came to the\\nplace, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat\\nI could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when I\\ncame to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large\\nby a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new\\nimaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree, so\\nthat I shook with cold like one in an ague; and I went home again,\\nfilled with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there;\\nor, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised\\nbefore I was aware; and what course to take for my security I knew not.\\n\\nOh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It\\ndeprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their\\nrelief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my\\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the\\nenemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the\\nsame or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two\\ncorn-fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be\\nprompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent,\\nthat they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to\\nlook farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.\\n\\nThese were the subject of the first night s cogitations after I was\\ncome home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind\\nwere fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours. Thus, fear of\\ndanger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when\\napparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by\\nmuch, than the evil which we are anxious about: and what was worse than\\nall this, I had not that relief in this trouble that from the\\nresignation I used to practise I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,\\nlike Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were upon him,\\nbut that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to\\ncompose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon His\\nprovidence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance;\\nwhich, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported\\nunder this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more\\nresolution.\\n\\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the\\nmorning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as\\nit were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and\\nwaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began\\nto think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this\\nisland (which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther\\nfrom the mainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as\\nI might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who\\nlived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from\\nthe shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they were\\ndriven by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had lived there\\nfifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of\\nany people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it\\nwas probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing\\nthey had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most\\nI could suggest any danger from was from any casual accidental landing\\nof straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were\\ndriven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay\\nhere, but went off again with all possible speed; seldom staying one\\nnight on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and\\ndaylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to\\nconsider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land\\nupon the spot.\\n\\nNow, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to\\nbring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond\\nwhere my fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering\\nthis, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the\\nmanner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had\\nplanted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I\\nmade mention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they\\nwanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they might be\\nthicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. So that I had\\nnow a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of\\ntimber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong;\\nhaving in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out\\nat. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick\\nwith continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the\\nfoot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I\\ncontrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got\\nseven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon, and\\nfitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I\\ncould fire all the seven guns in two minutes  time; this wall I was\\nmany a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till\\nit was done.\\n\\nWhen this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\\nlength every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,\\nwhich I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I\\nbelieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty\\nlarge space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an\\nenemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they\\nattempted to approach my outer wall.\\n\\nThus in two years  time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years \\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and\\nstrong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what\\nkind soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much\\nless a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in\\nand out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a\\npart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to\\nplace another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down\\nno man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and\\nif they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\\n\\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\\npreservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not\\naltogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time\\nmore than my mere fear suggested to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. A CAVE RETREAT\\n\\n\\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other\\naffairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats:\\nthey were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to\\nbe sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also\\nwithout the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to\\nlose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over\\nagain.\\n\\nFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two\\nways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig\\na cave underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the\\nother was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one\\nanother, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about\\nhalf-a-dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster\\nhappened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again\\nwith little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good\\ndeal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.\\n\\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of\\nthe island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my\\nheart could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of\\nthe hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself\\nonce before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part\\nof the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so\\nsurrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at\\nleast, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other\\npiece of ground I had worked so hard at.\\n\\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than\\na month s time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it\\nwhich you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be\\nsupposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further\\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece,\\nand when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had\\nmade it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure,\\nand it took me up more time by a great deal. All this labour I was at\\nthe expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of\\na man s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near\\nthe island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,\\nindeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may\\nbe well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant\\nsnare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too,\\nthat the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the\\nreligious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into\\nthe hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I\\nseldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker; at\\nleast, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was\\nwont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and\\npressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every\\nnight of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must\\ntestify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,\\nlove, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that\\nof terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief\\nimpending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the\\nduty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for\\nthese discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and the\\ndiscomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as\\nthat of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an\\nact of the mind, not of the body.\\n\\nBut to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little living\\nstock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private\\nplace to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west\\npoint of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I\\nthought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a\\nperspective glass or two in one of the seamen s chests, which I saved\\nout of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that\\nI could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes\\nwere not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was a boat or not\\nI do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of\\nit, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a\\nperspective glass in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the\\nend of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was\\npresently convinced that the seeing the print of a man s foot was not\\nsuch a strange thing in the island as I imagined: and but that it was a\\nspecial providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where\\nthe savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was\\nmore frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to\\nbe a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the\\nisland for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their\\ncanoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over\\nto this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all\\ncannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.\\n\\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the\\nSW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is\\nit possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore\\nspread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and\\nparticularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a\\ncircle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage\\nwretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their\\nfellow-creatures.\\n\\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained\\nno notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my\\napprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,\\nhellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,\\nwhich, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view\\nof before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle;\\nmy stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when\\nnature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with\\nuncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay\\nin the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I\\ncould, and walked on towards my own habitation.\\n\\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still\\nawhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the\\nutmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes,\\ngave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world\\nwhere I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and\\nthat, though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had\\nyet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give\\nthanks for than to complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even\\nin this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of\\nHimself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a felicity more than\\nsufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or\\ncould suffer.\\n\\nIn this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be\\nmuch easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was\\nbefore: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in\\nsearch of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not\\nexpecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the\\ncovered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose. I\\nknew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least\\nfootsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years\\nmore as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself\\nto them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only\\nbusiness to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found\\na better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet\\nI entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have\\nbeen speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their\\ndevouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,\\nand kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this:\\nwhen I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations viz. my\\ncastle, my country seat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in\\nthe woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than an\\nenclosure for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these\\nhellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of\\nseeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat\\nall this time, but began rather to think of making another; for I could\\nnot think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat\\nround the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures\\nat sea; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their\\nhands, I knew what would have been my lot.\\n\\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of\\nbeing discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about\\nthem; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before,\\nonly with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes\\nmore about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any\\nof them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest\\nany of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it. It was,\\ntherefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself\\nwith a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more\\nabout the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after\\nthis, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two\\nyears after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I\\nnever went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three\\npistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least\\ntwo of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I also furbished up\\none of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a\\nbelt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to\\nlook at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of\\nmyself the particular of two pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my\\nside in a belt, but without a scabbard.\\n\\nThings going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,\\nexcepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way\\nof living. All these things tended to show me more and more how far my\\ncondition was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to\\nmany other particulars of life which it might have pleased God to have\\nmade my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would\\nbe among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather\\ncompare their condition with those that were worse, in order to be\\nthankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to\\nassist their murmurings and complainings.\\n\\nAs in my present condition there were not really many things which I\\nwanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these\\nsavage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,\\nhad taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences; and I\\nhad dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and\\nthat was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and\\nthen try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought,\\nand I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently\\nsaw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making\\nmy beer that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks\\nto preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,\\nI could never compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but\\nweeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next\\nplace, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no\\ncopper or kettle to make it boil; and yet with all these things\\nwanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in\\nabout the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought\\nit to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing\\nit, when once I had it in my head to began it. But my invention now ran\\nquite another way; for night and day I could think of nothing but how I\\nmight destroy some of the monsters in their cruel, bloody\\nentertainment, and if possible save the victim they should bring hither\\nto destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is\\nintended to be to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather\\nbrooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at\\nleast frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more:\\nbut all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect,\\nunless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one man do\\namong them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them\\ntogether with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they\\ncould shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?\\n\\nSometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made\\ntheir fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when\\nthey kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all\\nthat was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to\\nwaste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity\\nof one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any\\ncertain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would\\ndo little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright\\nthem, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it\\naside; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some\\nconvenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the\\nmiddle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure\\nto kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling\\nin upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but\\nthat, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy pleased\\nmy thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often\\ndreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them\\nin my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination that I employed\\nmyself several days to find out proper places to put myself in\\nambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went frequently to the\\nplace itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while my\\nmind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting\\ntwenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I\\nhad at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches\\ndevouring one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length I found a\\nplace in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might securely\\nwait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even before\\nthey would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some\\nthickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to\\nconceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their bloody\\ndoings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close\\ntogether as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my\\nshot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first\\nshot. In this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and\\naccordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The\\ntwo muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five\\nsmaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the\\nfowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest\\nsize; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and, in\\nthis posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third\\ncharge, I prepared myself for my expedition.\\n\\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination\\nput it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top\\nof the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three\\nmiles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming\\nnear the island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of\\nthis hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my\\nwatch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in\\nall that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the\\nshore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach\\nevery way.\\n\\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also\\nI kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the\\nwhile in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing\\ntwenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all\\nentered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my\\npassions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural\\ncustom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered\\nby Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other\\nguide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and\\nconsequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act\\nsuch horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but\\nnature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish\\ndegeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I\\nbegan to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long\\nand so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself\\nbegan to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to\\nconsider what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to\\npretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom\\nHeaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on,\\nand to be as it were the executioners of His judgments one upon\\nanother; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right\\nI had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed\\npromiscuously upon one another. I debated this very often with myself\\nthus:  How do I know what God Himself judges in this particular case?\\nIt is certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not\\nagainst their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching\\nthem; they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in\\ndefiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.\\nThey think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do\\nto kill an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton. \\n\\nWhen I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was\\ncertainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the\\nsense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than\\nthose Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners\\ntaken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole\\ntroops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw\\ndown their arms and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me\\nthat although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and\\ninhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no\\ninjury: that if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate\\npreservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it: but\\nthat I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of\\nme, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be\\njust for me to fall upon them; that this would justify the conduct of\\nthe Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in America, where they\\ndestroyed millions of these people; who, however they were idolators\\nand barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their\\ncustoms, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as\\nto the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out\\nof the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation\\nby even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other\\nChristian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural\\npiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and for which the\\nvery name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible, to\\nall people of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of\\nSpain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who\\nwere without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to\\nthe miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the\\nmind.\\n\\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\\nstop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to\\nconclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the\\nsavages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless\\nthey first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to\\nprevent: but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my\\nduty. On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the\\nway not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for\\nunless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at\\nthat time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of\\nthem escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they would\\ncome over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and\\nI should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at\\npresent, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded\\nthat I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to\\nconcern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all possible\\nmeans to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least sign for\\nthem to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island I\\nmean of human shape. Religion joined in with this prudential\\nresolution; and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly\\nout of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the\\ndestruction of innocent creatures I mean innocent as to me. As to the\\ncrimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do\\nwith them; they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice\\nof God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national\\npunishments, to make a just retribution for national offences, and to\\nbring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by\\nsuch ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to me now, that\\nnothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been\\nsuffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe would\\nhave been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if I had committed\\nit; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that He had thus\\ndelivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me the\\nprotection of His providence, that I might not fall into the hands of\\nthe barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I\\nhad a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.\\n\\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far\\nwas I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that\\nin all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there\\nwere any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on\\nshore there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my\\ncontrivances against them, or be provoked by any advantage that might\\npresent itself to fall upon them; only this I did: I went and removed\\nmy boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it\\ndown to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little\\ncove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason\\nof the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with\\ntheir boats upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried away\\neverything that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary\\nfor the bare going thither viz. a mast and sail which I had made for\\nher, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called\\neither anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its\\nkind: all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow for\\ndiscovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon\\nthe island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than\\never, and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment,\\nto milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as\\nit was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger; for\\ncertain, it is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this\\nisland, never came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and\\nconsequently never wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but\\nthey might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of\\nthem had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked back\\nwith some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been\\nif I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that; when, naked\\nand unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small\\nshot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see\\nwhat I could get; what a surprise should I have been in if, when I\\ndiscovered the print of a man s foot, I had, instead of that, seen\\nfifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the\\nswiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping them! The\\nthoughts of this sometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed\\nmy mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to think what I\\nshould have done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist\\nthem, but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I\\nmight have done; much less what now, after so much consideration and\\npreparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of\\nthese things, I would be melancholy, and sometimes it would last a\\ngreat while; but I resolved it all at last into thankfulness to that\\nProvidence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had\\nkept me from those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent\\nin delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any\\nsuch thing depending, or the least supposition of its being possible.\\nThis renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in\\nformer times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of\\nHeaven, in the dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we\\nare delivered when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a\\nquandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or\\nthat way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to\\ngo that way: nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business\\nhas called us to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the\\nmind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what power,\\nshall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear that\\nhad we gone that way, which we should have gone, and even to our\\nimagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.\\nUpon these and many like reflections I afterwards made it a certain\\nrule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of\\nmind to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going this way\\nor that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew\\nno other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon my\\nmind. I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in the\\ncourse of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my\\ninhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it is very\\nlikely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes\\nthen that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I\\ncannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with\\nsuch extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so\\nextraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let\\nthem come from what invisible intelligence they will. That I shall not\\ndiscuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are a proof\\nof the converse of spirits, and a secret communication between those\\nembodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never be\\nwithstood; of which I shall have occasion to give some remarkable\\ninstances in the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal\\nplace.\\n\\nI believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess\\nthat these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the\\nconcern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all\\nthe contrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations and\\nconveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than\\nthat of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood\\nnow, for fear the noise I might make should be heard: much less would I\\nfire a gun for the same reason: and above all I was intolerably uneasy\\nat making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great\\ndistance in the day, should betray me. For this reason, I removed that\\npart of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots and\\npipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been\\nsome time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave\\nin the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I daresay, no\\nsavage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture\\nin; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted\\nnothing so much as a safe retreat.\\n\\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by\\nmere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe\\nall such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick\\nbranches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on I must observe\\nthe reason of my making this charcoal, which was this I was afraid of\\nmaking a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could\\nnot live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I\\ncontrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under\\nturf, till it became chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out,\\nI preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services for\\nwhich fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is\\nby-the-bye. While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that,\\nbehind a very thick branch of low brushwood or underwood, there was a\\nkind of hollow place: I was curious to look in it; and getting with\\ndifficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is\\nto say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another\\nwith me: but I must confess to you that I made more haste out than I\\ndid in, when looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly\\ndark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or\\nman I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the\\ncave s mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection. However,\\nafter some pause I recovered myself, and began to call myself a\\nthousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil\\nwas not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I\\nmight well think there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful\\nthan myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand,\\nand in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not\\ngone three steps in before I was almost as frightened as before; for I\\nheard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was\\nfollowed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep\\nsigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise\\nthat it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I\\nwill not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off. But\\nstill plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself\\na little with considering that the power and presence of God was\\neverywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by\\nthe light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw\\nlying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his\\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old\\nage. I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he\\nessayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought\\nwith myself he might even lie there for if he had frightened me, so he\\nwould certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so\\nhardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.\\n\\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when\\nI found the cave was but very small that is to say, it might be about\\ntwelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square,\\nno hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere\\nNature. I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of\\nit that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep\\nupon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not;\\nso, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go\\nagain the next day provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had\\nmade of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.\\n\\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my\\nown making (for I made very good candles now of goat s tallow, but was\\nhard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and\\nsometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this\\nlow place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours as I have said, almost\\nten yards which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough,\\nconsidering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond\\nit. When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up,\\nI believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in\\nthe island, I daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of\\nthis vault or cave the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me\\nfrom my two candles. What it was in the rock whether diamonds or any\\nother precious stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be I knew\\nnot. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though\\nperfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small\\nloose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous\\ncreature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or\\nroof. The only difficulty in it was the entrance which, however, as it\\nwas a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was\\na convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and\\nresolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was\\nmost anxious about to this place: particularly, I resolved to bring\\nhither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms viz. two\\nfowling-pieces for I had three in all and three muskets for of them I\\nhad eight in all; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready\\nmounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also\\nto take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my\\nammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out\\nof the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water had\\npenetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side,\\nwhich caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel\\nin the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in\\nthe centre of the cask. This was a very agreeable discovery to me at\\nthat time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or\\nthree pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of\\nany kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.\\n\\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to\\nlive in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them;\\nfor I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages\\nwere to hunt me, they could never find me out or if they did, they\\nwould not venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found expiring\\ndied in the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery;\\nand I found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in\\nand cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him\\nthere, to prevent offence to my nose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP\\n\\n\\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and\\nwas so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I\\nbut have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place\\nto disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for\\nspending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had\\nlaid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also\\narrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time\\npass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before first, I\\nhad taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so\\nfamiliarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very\\npleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years.\\nHow long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they\\nhave a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog was\\na pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of\\nmy time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they\\nmultiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to\\nshoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all\\nI had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were\\ngone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting\\nthem have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods,\\nexcept two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young,\\nwhen they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my family.\\nBesides these I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom\\nI taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which\\ntalked pretty well, and would all call  Robin Crusoe,  but none like my\\nfirst; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had\\ndone with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew\\nnot, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little\\nstakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to\\na good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and\\nbred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I\\nbegan to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have\\nbeen secured from the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise\\ndirected; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my\\nstory to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the\\ncourse of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and\\nwhich, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is\\noftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we\\ncan be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could\\ngive many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but\\nin nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the\\ncircumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.\\n\\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\\nit), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be\\npretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning,\\neven before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a\\nlight of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two\\nmiles, toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages\\nhad been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great\\naffliction, it was on my side of the island.\\n\\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within\\nmy grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I\\nhad no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these\\nsavages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or\\ncut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately\\nconclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest\\ntill they had found me out. In this extremity I went back directly to\\nmy castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without\\nlook as wild and natural as I could.\\n\\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.\\nI loaded all my cannon, as I called them that is to say, my muskets,\\nwhich were mounted upon my new fortification and all my pistols, and\\nresolved to defend myself to the last gasp not forgetting seriously to\\ncommend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God\\nto deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this\\nposture about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence\\nabroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting a while longer,\\nand musing what I should do in this case, I was not able to bear\\nsitting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the\\nhill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then\\npulling the ladder after me, I set it up again and mounted the top of\\nthe hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on\\npurpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to\\nlook for the place. I presently found there were no less than nine\\nnaked savages sitting round a small fire they had made, not to warm\\nthem, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely hot,\\nbut, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human\\nflesh which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could\\nnot tell.\\n\\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore;\\nand as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the\\nreturn of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what\\nconfusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my\\nside of the island, and so near to me; but when I considered their\\ncoming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards\\nto be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad\\nwith safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on\\nshore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my\\nharvest work with the more composure.\\n\\nAs I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the\\nwestward I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it)\\naway. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went\\noff they were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and\\ngestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation,\\nbut that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon\\nthem; but whether they were men or women I could not distinguish.\\n\\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\\nshoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side\\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away\\nto the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as\\nsoon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I\\ncould not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived\\nthere had been three canoes more of the savages at that place; and\\nlooking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over\\nfor the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going\\ndown to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal\\nwork they had been about had left behind it viz. the blood, the bones,\\nand part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those\\nwretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at\\nthe sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the next\\nthat I saw there, let them be whom or how many soever. It seemed\\nevident to me that the visits which they made thus to this island were\\nnot very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of\\nthem came on shore there again that is to say, I neither saw them nor\\nany footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to the rainy\\nseasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far.\\nYet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant\\napprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise: from whence I\\nobserve, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the\\nsuffering, especially if there is no room to shake off that expectation\\nor those apprehensions.\\n\\nDuring all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my\\nhours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\\ncircumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see\\nthem especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,\\ninto two parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one\\nparty suppose ten or a dozen I was still the next day, or week, or\\nmonth, to kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I\\nshould be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being\\nman-eaters and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great\\nperplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or\\nother fall into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at\\nany time venture abroad, it was not without looking around me with the\\ngreatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great\\ncomfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of\\ngoats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near\\nthat side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm\\nthe savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them\\ncome again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few\\ndays, and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and\\nthree months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I\\nfound them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have\\nbeen there once or twice; but either they made no stay, or at least I\\ndid not see them; but in the month of May, as near as I could\\ncalculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange\\nencounter with them; of which in its place.\\n\\nThe perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months \\ninterval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful\\ndreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night. In the day\\ngreat troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed often of\\nkilling the savages and of the reasons why I might justify doing it.\\n\\nBut to waive all this for a while. It was in the middle of May, on the\\nsixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would\\nreckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the\\nsixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with\\na great deal of lightning and thunder, and; a very foul night it was\\nafter it. I knew not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I\\nwas reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about\\nmy present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I\\nthought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a\\ndifferent nature from any I had met with before; for the notions this\\nput into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the\\ngreatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the\\nmiddle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the\\nsecond time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of\\nfire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half\\na minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of\\nthe sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately\\nconsidered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had\\nsome comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these for\\nsignals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind at\\nthat minute to think, that though I could not help them, it might be\\nthat they might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could\\nget at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the\\nhill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew\\nvery hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there\\nwas any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it. And no doubt they\\ndid; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and\\nafter that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire\\nall night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air\\ncleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of\\nthe island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish no, not\\nwith my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still\\nsomething hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.\\n\\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and\\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my\\nhand, and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I\\nhad formerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there,\\nthe weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to\\nmy great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which\\nrocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\\ncounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the\\nmost desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my\\nlife. Thus, what is one man s safety is another man s destruction; for\\nit seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge,\\nand the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in\\nthe night, the wind blowing hard at ENE. Had they seen the island, as I\\nmust necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have\\nendeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their\\nboat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as\\nI imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined\\nthat upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their\\nboat, and endeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very\\nhigh, they might have been cast away. Other times I imagined that they\\nmight have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways;\\nparticularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many\\ntimes obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and\\nsometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other times I\\nimagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the\\nsignals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them off.\\nOther times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and\\nbeing hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were\\ncarried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery\\nand perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of\\nstarving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.\\n\\nAs all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was\\nin, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men,\\nand pity them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it\\ngave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily\\nand comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of\\ntwo ships  companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the\\nworld, not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again to\\nobserve, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into\\nany condition so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something\\nor other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances\\nthan our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could\\nnot so much as see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make\\nit rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish\\nthere, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another\\nship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw\\nnot the least sign or appearance of any such thing. I cannot explain,\\nby any possible energy of words, what a strange longing I felt in my\\nsoul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus:  Oh that there had\\nbeen but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of this ship, to\\nhave escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one\\nfellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have conversed with!  In\\nall the time of my solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong a\\ndesire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at\\nthe want of it.\\n\\nThere are some secret springs in the affections which, when they are\\nset a-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet\\nrendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion\\ncarries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager\\nembracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable. Such\\nwere these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe\\nI repeated the words,  Oh that it had been but one!  a thousand times;\\nand my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my\\nhands would clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms of my\\nhands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my hand I should have\\ncrushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike\\ntogether, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I\\ncould not part them again. Let the naturalists explain these things,\\nand the reason and manner of them. All I can do is to describe the\\nfact, which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew\\nnot from whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the effect of ardent\\nwishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort\\nwhich the conversation of one of my fellow-Christians would have been\\nto me. But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both,\\nforbade it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never\\nknew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the\\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on\\nshore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no\\nclothes on but a seaman s waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen\\ndrawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to\\nguess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pockets but two\\npieces of eight and a tobacco pipe the last was to me of ten times more\\nvalue than the first.\\n\\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to\\nthis wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might\\nbe useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much as the\\npossibility that there might be yet some living creature on board,\\nwhose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,\\ncomfort my own to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my\\nheart that I could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in\\nmy boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God s\\nprovidence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it\\ncould not be resisted that it must come from some invisible direction,\\nand that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go.\\n\\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,\\nprepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great\\npot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had\\nstill a great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus,\\nloading myself with everything necessary. I went down to my boat, got\\nthe water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and\\nthen went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice,\\nthe umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot of\\nwater, and about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than\\nbefore, with a bottle of goat s milk and a cheese; all which with great\\nlabour and sweat I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my\\nvoyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore,\\ncame at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.\\nAnd now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or\\nnot to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on\\nboth sides of the island at a distance, and which were very terrible to\\nme from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my\\nheart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either\\nof those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and\\nperhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as\\nmy boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should\\nbe inevitably lost.\\n\\nThese thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my\\nenterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore,\\nI stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive\\nand anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was\\nmusing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come\\non; upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this,\\npresently it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of\\nground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide\\nor currents lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if\\nI was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way\\nhome, with the same rapidity of the currents. This thought was no\\nsooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill which\\nsufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a\\nclear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to\\nguide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the current of ebb set\\nout close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood\\nset in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to\\ndo but to keep to the north side of the island in my return, and I\\nshould do well enough.\\n\\nEncouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to set out\\nwith the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my\\ncanoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a\\nlittle out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the\\ncurrent, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and\\nyet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done\\nbefore, so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a\\nstrong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the\\nwreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal\\nsight to look at; the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck\\nfast, jammed in between two rocks. All the stern and quarter of her\\nwere beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in\\nthe rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast\\nwere brought by the board that is to say, broken short off; but her\\nbowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came\\nclose to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped\\nand cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to\\nme. I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and\\nthirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a\\nravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow; I then\\ngave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have\\nlet him, he would have burst himself. After this I went on board; but\\nthe first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or\\nforecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I\\nconcluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being\\nin a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her, that the\\nmen were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant\\nrushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water.\\nBesides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor\\nany goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There\\nwere some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay\\nlower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;\\nbut they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I\\nbelieve belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into the\\nboat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship\\nbeen fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have\\nmade a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room\\nto suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may\\nguess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos\\nAyres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the\\nBrazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to\\nSpain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at\\nthat time, to anybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.\\n\\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There\\nwere several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\\nfour pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for\\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel\\nand tongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles,\\na copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,\\nand the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again and the\\nsame evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again,\\nweary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat\\nand in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave,\\nand not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all\\nmy cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of\\nliquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the\\nBrazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the\\nchests, I found several things of great use to me for example, I found\\nin one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled\\nwith cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three\\npints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good\\nsuccades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the\\nsalt-water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water\\nhad spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to\\nme; and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and\\ncoloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being\\nexceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when\\nI came to the till in the chest, I found there three great bags of\\npieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in\\none of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some\\nsmall bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a\\npound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but,\\nby the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner s mate;\\nthough there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed\\npowder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their\\nfowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this\\nvoyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner\\nof occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would\\nhave given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and\\nstockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my\\nfeet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I\\ntook off the feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I\\nfound two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to\\nme; but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or\\nservice, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this\\nseaman s chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I\\nsupposed this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to\\nbelong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money home to my\\ncave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought\\nfrom our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other\\npart of this ship had not come to my share: for I am satisfied I might\\nhave loaded my canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if\\nI ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come\\nagain and fetch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. A DREAM REALISED\\n\\n\\nHaving now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back\\nto my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old\\nharbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old\\nhabitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to\\nrepose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family\\naffairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more\\nvigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad\\nso much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always\\nto the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the\\nsavages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions,\\nand such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I\\nwent the other way.\\n\\n\\nI lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head,\\nthat was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,\\nwas all these two years filled with projects and designs how, if it\\nwere possible, I might get away from this island: for sometimes I was\\nfor making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that\\nthere was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes\\nfor a ramble one way, sometimes another and I believe verily, if I had\\nhad the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea,\\nbound anywhere, I knew not whither.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are\\ntouched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know,\\none half of their miseries flow: I mean that of not being satisfied\\nwith the station wherein God and Nature hath placed them for, not to\\nlook back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my\\nfather, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original\\nsin_, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my\\ncoming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence which so\\nhappily seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined\\ndesires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I\\nmight have been by this time I mean in the time of my being in this\\nisland one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils nay, I am\\npersuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I\\nlived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had\\nremained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores and what\\nbusiness had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation,\\nimproving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch\\nnegroes, when patience and time would have so increased our stock at\\nhome, that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose\\nbusiness it was to fetch them? and though it had cost us something\\nmore, yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at\\nso great a hazard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the\\nfolly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the\\ndear-bought experience of time so it was with me now; and yet so deep\\nhad the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy\\nmyself in my station, but was continually poring upon the means and\\npossibility of my escape from this place; and that I may, with greater\\npleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may\\nnot be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the\\nsubject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what\\nfoundation, I acted.\\n\\nI am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\\ncondition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed,\\nthan I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use\\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\\n\\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the\\nfour-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of\\nsolitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health,\\nhad no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of\\nmind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is,\\nso as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that\\nwhirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in\\nthis night s time. I ran over the whole history of my life in\\nminiature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this\\nisland, and also of that part of my life since I came to this island.\\nIn my reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on\\nthis island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the\\nfirst years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and\\ncare which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in\\nthe sand. Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the\\nisland even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them\\nat times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of\\nany apprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my\\ndanger was the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if\\nI had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with\\nmany very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How\\ninfinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its\\ngovernment of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of\\nthings; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers,\\nthe sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and\\nsink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of\\nthings hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which\\nsurround him.\\n\\nAfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to\\nreflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years\\nin this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest\\nsecurity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing\\nbut the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night,\\nhad been between me and the worst kind of destruction viz. that of\\nfalling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized\\non me with the same view as I would on a goat or turtle; and have\\nthought it no more crime to kill and devour me than I did of a pigeon\\nor a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not\\nsincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection\\nI acknowledged, with great humanity, all these unknown deliverances\\nwere due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their\\nmerciless hands.\\n\\nWhen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\\nand how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all\\nthings should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity nay, to\\nsomething so much below even brutality itself as to devour its own\\nkind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations,\\nit occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches\\nlived in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what they\\nventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and\\nwhy I might not order myself and my business so that I might be able to\\ngo over thither, as they were to come to me?\\n\\nI never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\\nmyself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the\\nhands of these savages; or how I should escape them if they attacked\\nme; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,\\nand not to be attacked by some or other of them, without any\\npossibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their\\nhands, what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my\\ncourse; none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but\\nmy mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat\\nto the mainland. I looked upon my present condition as the most\\nmiserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself\\ninto anything but death, that could be called worse; and if I reached\\nthe shore of the main I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might\\ncoast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to some\\ninhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and after all,\\nperhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in:\\nand if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an\\nend to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of\\na disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by\\nthe long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met\\nin the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near\\nobtaining what I so earnestly longed for somebody to speak to, and to\\nlearn some knowledge from them of the place where I was, and of the\\nprobable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by these\\nthoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and\\nwaiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be\\nsuspended; and I had as it were no power to turn my thoughts to\\nanything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me\\nwith such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to\\nbe resisted.\\n\\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such\\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as\\nif I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my\\nmind about it, Nature as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the\\nvery thoughts of it threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought\\nI should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to\\nit, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual from\\nmy castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to\\nland, and that they brought with them another savage whom they were\\ngoing to kill in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that\\nthey were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I\\nthought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove\\nbefore my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone,\\nand not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself\\nto him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to\\nme, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my\\nladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my\\nservant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself,  Now\\nI may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me\\nas a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for\\nprovisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what\\nplaces to venture into, and what to shun.  I waked with this thought;\\nand was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of\\nmy escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon\\ncoming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were\\nequally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great\\ndejection of spirits.\\n\\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to go\\nabout to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my\\npossession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom\\nthey had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But\\nthese thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: that it was\\nimpossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them,\\nand killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt,\\nand might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the\\nlawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of\\nshedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not\\nrepeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the\\nsame mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now viz.\\nthat those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they\\ncould; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver\\nmyself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as\\nmuch as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say though\\nthese things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood\\nfor my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no\\nmeans reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after\\nmany secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it\\n(for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a\\nlong time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length\\nmastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these\\nsavages into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to\\ncontrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve\\non; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved\\nto put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and\\nleave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity\\nshould present, let what would be.\\n\\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\\noften as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it;\\nfor it was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of\\nthat time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the\\nisland almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This\\nwas very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot\\nsay that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off\\nthe edge of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be\\ndelayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so\\ncareful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by\\nthem, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself\\nable to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to\\nmake them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,\\nand to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a\\ngreat while that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still\\npresented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no\\nsavages came near me for a great while.\\n\\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long\\nmusing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an\\noccasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by\\nseeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the\\nisland, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my\\nsight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many,\\nand knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a\\nboat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures\\nto attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my\\ncastle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into the same\\nposition for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready\\nfor action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while,\\nlistening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very\\nimpatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to\\nthe top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however,\\nthat my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not\\nperceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my\\nperspective glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that\\nthey had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had\\ncooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I\\nknow not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round\\nthe fire.\\n\\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\\nthem immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\\nwooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at\\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.\\nIn that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at\\nliberty and unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he\\nstarted away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the\\nsands, directly towards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where\\nmy habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,\\nwhen I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I\\nsaw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my\\ndream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in\\nmy grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the\\nother savages would not pursue him thither and find him there. However,\\nI kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that\\nthere was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I\\nencouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in\\nrunning, and gained ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out\\nfor half-an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.\\n\\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the\\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\\nwretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither,\\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran\\nwith exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to\\nthe creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but\\nwent no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it\\nhappened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two who\\nswam were yet more than twice as strong swimming over the creek as the\\nfellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts,\\nand indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant,\\nand, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called\\nby Providence to save this poor creature s life. I immediately ran down\\nthe ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they\\nwere both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting\\nup again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards\\nthe sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself\\nin the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him\\nthat fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened\\nat me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and,\\nin the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then\\nrushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of\\nmy piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear;\\nthough, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and\\nbeing out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what to\\nmake of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him\\nstopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards him: but\\nas I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was\\nfitting it to shoot at me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him first,\\nwhich I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who\\nfled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and\\nkilled, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of\\nmy piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went\\nbackward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come\\non. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he\\neasily understood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and then\\na little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he\\nstood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to\\nbe killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to\\nme, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of;\\nand he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps,\\nin token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and\\nlooked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length\\nhe came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\\nand laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my\\nfoot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my\\nslave for ever. I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him\\nall I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the\\nsavage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the\\nblow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him\\nthe savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to me,\\nand though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were\\npleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man s voice that I\\nhad heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was\\nno time for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down\\nrecovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived\\nthat my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my\\nother piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage,\\nfor so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which\\nhung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner had it, but\\nhe runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly, no\\nexecutioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I\\nthought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a\\nsword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however, it\\nseems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp,\\nso heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads\\nwith them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow, too. When he had done\\nthis, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the\\nsword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,\\nlaid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just\\nbefore me. But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed\\nthe other Indian so far off; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me\\nto let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I could. When he\\ncame to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him\\nfirst on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet\\nhad made, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a\\nhole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled\\ninwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and\\ncame back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me,\\nmaking signs to him that more might come after them. Upon this he made\\nsigns to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be\\nseen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to\\ndo so. He fell to work; and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the\\nsand with his hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged\\nhim into it, and covered him; and did so by the other also; I believe\\nhe had him buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then, calling\\naway, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on\\nthe farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass\\nin that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him\\nbread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I\\nfound he was indeed in great distress for, from his running: and having\\nrefreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep,\\nshowing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket\\nupon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor\\ncreature lay down, and went to sleep.\\n\\nHe was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight,\\nstrong limbs, not too large; tall, and well-shaped; and, as I reckon,\\nabout twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a\\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his\\nface; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in\\nhis countenance, too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and\\nblack, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a\\ngreat vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his\\nskin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow,\\nnauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of\\nAmerica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it\\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face\\nwas round and plump; his nose small, not flat, like the negroes; a very\\ngood mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as\\nivory.\\n\\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour, he awoke\\nagain, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats\\nwhich I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me he came running\\nto me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible\\nsigns of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic\\ngestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,\\nclose to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done\\nbefore; and after this made all the signs to me of subjection,\\nservitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve\\nme so long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him\\nknow I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to\\nspeak to him; and teach him to speak to me; and first, I let him know\\nhis name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; I called\\nhim so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master;\\nand then let him know that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to\\nsay Yes and No and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in\\nan earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my\\nbread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he\\nquickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I\\nkept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day I\\nbeckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him some\\nclothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we\\nwent by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly\\nto the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them\\nagain, making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat\\nthem. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,\\nmade as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my\\nhand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great\\nsubmission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his\\nenemies were gone; and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly\\nthe place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their\\ncanoes; so that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two\\ncomrades behind them, without any search after them.\\n\\nBut I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving\\nhim the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I\\nfound he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,\\nand I two for myself; and away we marched to the place where these\\ncreatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some further\\nintelligence of them. When I came to the place my very blood ran chill\\nin my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the\\nspectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,\\nthough Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human\\nbones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left\\nhere and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all\\nthe tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a\\nvictory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the\\nbones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of\\nthe bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they\\nbrought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were\\neaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there\\nhad been a great battle between them and their next king, of whose\\nsubjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great\\nnumber of prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those\\nwho had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was\\ndone here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.\\n\\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\\nremained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon\\nit, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering\\nstomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his\\nnature; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and\\nat the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I\\nhad, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered\\nit.\\n\\nWhen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to\\nwork for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner s chest I mentioned, which\\nI found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him\\nvery well; and then I made him a jerkin of goat s skin, as well as my\\nskill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I\\ngave him a cap which I made of hare s skin, very convenient, and\\nfashionable enough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably\\nwell, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed\\nas his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first:\\nwearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the\\nwaistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little\\neasing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to\\nthem, he took to them at length very well.\\n\\nThe next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to\\nconsider where I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him and\\nyet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the\\nvacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last,\\nand in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there\\ninto my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of\\nboards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance;\\nand, causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the\\nnight, taking in my ladders, too; so that Friday could no way come at\\nme in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in\\ngetting over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had now a\\ncomplete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning\\nup to the side of the hill; which was again laid across with smaller\\nsticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with\\nthe rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place\\nwhich was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of\\ntrap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not\\nhave opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great\\nnoise as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But I\\nneeded none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faithful,\\nloving, sincere servant than Friday was to me: without passions,\\nsullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very\\naffections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and I\\ndaresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any\\noccasion whatsoever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out\\nof doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for\\nmy safety on his account.\\n\\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\\nhowever it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of\\nthe works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of\\nHis creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of\\ntheir souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same\\npowers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of\\nkindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,\\nthe same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the\\ncapacities of doing good and receiving good that He has given to us;\\nand that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these,\\nthey are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for\\nwhich they were bestowed than we are. This made me very melancholy\\nsometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean\\na use we make of all these, even though we have these powers\\nenlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by\\nthe knowledge of His word added to our understanding; and why it has\\npleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of\\nsouls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much\\nbetter use of it than we did. From hence I sometimes was led too far,\\nto invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the\\njustice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that\\nsight from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty\\nfrom both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this\\nconclusion: first, that we did not know by what light and law these\\nshould be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature\\nof His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if\\nthese creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on\\naccount of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says, was\\na law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would\\nacknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us;\\nand secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the\\npotter, no vessel could say to him,  Why hast thou formed me thus? \\n\\nBut to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with him,\\nand made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make\\nhim useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\\nunderstand me when I spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever\\nwas; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so\\npleased when he could but understand me, or make me understand him,\\nthat it was very pleasant for me to talk to him. Now my life began to\\nbe so easy that I began to say to myself that could I but have been\\nsafe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the\\nplace where I lived.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. FRIDAY S EDUCATION\\n\\n\\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought\\nthat, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and\\nfrom the relish of a cannibal s stomach, I ought to let him taste other\\nflesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,\\nindeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock; and bring it home\\nand dress it; but as I was going I saw a she-goat lying down in the\\nshade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday.\\n Hold,  said I,  stand still;  and made signs to him not to stir:\\nimmediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The\\npoor creature, who had at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage,\\nhis enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine how it was done, was\\nsensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I\\nthought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or\\nperceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether\\nhe was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved\\nto kill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my\\nknees, said a great many things I did not understand; but I could\\neasily see the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.\\n\\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid\\nwhich I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did:\\nand while he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was\\nkilled, I loaded my gun again. By-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a\\nhawk, sitting upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a\\nlittle what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl,\\nwhich was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,\\npointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the\\nparrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that\\nI would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him\\nlook, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one\\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he\\nwas the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the\\ngun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and\\ndestruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything\\nnear or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such as\\ncould not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let\\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he\\nwould not so much as touch it for several days after; but he would\\nspeak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by\\nhimself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to\\nkill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I\\npointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but\\nstayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered\\naway a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found\\nher, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his\\nignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun\\nagain, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any\\nother mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time:\\nso I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off,\\nand cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that\\npurpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good\\nbroth. After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who seemed\\nvery glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest\\nto him was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the\\nsalt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he\\nseemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his\\nmouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat\\ninto my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for\\nwant of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not do;\\nhe would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not\\nfor a great while, and then but a very little.\\n\\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast\\nhim the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging\\nit before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in\\nEngland, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one\\nacross the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the\\nmeat turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came\\nto taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked\\nit, that I could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as\\nwell as he could, he would never eat man s flesh any more, which I was\\nvery glad to hear.\\n\\nThe next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and sifting it in\\nthe manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood\\nhow to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the\\nmeaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that I\\nlet him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time\\nFriday was able to do all the work for me as well as I could do it\\nmyself.\\n\\nI began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one,\\nI must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity\\nof corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and\\nbegan the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked\\nnot only very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and\\nI told him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,\\nbecause he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and\\nmyself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know\\nthat he thought I had much more labour upon me on his account than I\\nhad for myself; and that he would work the harder for me if I would\\ntell him what to do.\\n\\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\\nFriday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\\neverything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\\nhim to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now\\nto have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\\noccasion for before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a\\nsingular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned\\nhonesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to\\nlove the creature; and on his side I believe he loved me more than it\\nwas possible for him ever to love anything before.\\n\\nI had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country\\nagain; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me\\nalmost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to\\nnever conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said Yes, yes, we\\nalways fight the better;  that is, he meant always get the better in\\nfight; and so we began the following discourse: \\n\\n_Master_. You always fight the better; how came you to be taken\\nprisoner, then, Friday?\\n\\n_Friday_. My nation beat much for all that.\\n\\n_Master_. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\\n\\n_Friday_. They more many than my nation, in the place where me was;\\nthey take one, two, three, and me: my nation over-beat them in the\\nyonder place, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great\\nthousand.\\n\\n_Master_. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\\nenemies, then?\\n\\n_Friday_. They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe;\\nmy nation have no canoe that time.\\n\\n_Master_. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\\ntake? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\\n\\n_Master_. Where do they carry them?\\n\\n_Friday_. Go to other place, where they think.\\n\\n_Master_. Do they come hither?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\\n\\n_Master_. Have you been here with them?\\n\\n_Friday_. Yes, I have been here (points to the NW. side of the island,\\nwhich, it seems, was their side).\\n\\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\\nthe same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and some time\\nafter, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the\\nsame I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he\\nwas there once, when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child;\\nhe could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying so\\nmany stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\\n\\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows: that\\nafter this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from\\nour island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He\\ntold me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost: but that after a\\nlittle way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in\\nthe morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no\\nmore than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I\\nafterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux\\nof the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I\\nfound afterwards, our island lay; and that this land, which I perceived\\nto be W. and NW., was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of\\nthe mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the\\ncountry, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were\\nnear; he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable. I\\nasked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but\\ncould get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood\\nthat these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of\\nAmerica which reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to Guiana,\\nand onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the\\nmoon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from\\ntheir country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to\\nmy great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed\\nmuch mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he meant the\\nSpaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole\\ncountry, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.\\n\\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get\\namong those white men. He told me,  Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe. \\nI could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what\\nhe meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he\\nmeant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of\\nFriday s discourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I\\nentertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an\\nopportunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor\\nsavage might be a means to help me.\\n\\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he\\nbegan to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a\\nfoundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him\\none time, who made him. The creature did not understand me at all, but\\nthought I had asked who was his father but I took it up by another\\nhandle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and\\nthe hills and woods. He told me,  It was one Benamuckee, that lived\\nbeyond all;  he could describe nothing of this great person, but that\\nhe was very old,  much older,  he said,  than the sea or land, than the\\nmoon or the stars.  I asked him then, if this old person had made all\\nthings, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and,\\nwith a perfect look of innocence, said,  All things say O to him.  I\\nasked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere? He\\nsaid,  Yes; they all went to Benamuckee.  Then I asked him whether\\nthose they eat up went thither too. He said,  Yes. \\n\\nFrom these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\\nGod; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\\npointing up towards heaven; that He governed the world by the same\\npower and providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and\\ncould do everything for us, give everything to us, take everything from\\nus; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great\\nattention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being\\nsent to redeem us; and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and\\nHis being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if\\nour God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater\\nGod than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet\\ncould not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt\\nto speak to them. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him.\\nHe said,  No; they never went that were young men; none went thither\\nbut the old men,  whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made\\nhim explain to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to\\nsay O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back and told them\\nwhat Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is priestcraft\\neven among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the\\npolicy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the\\nveneration of the people to the clergy, not only to be found in the\\nRoman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among the\\nmost brutish and barbarous savages.\\n\\nI endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him\\nthat the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O\\nto their god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from\\nthence what he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer,\\nor spake with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I\\nentered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of\\nhim, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it,\\nhis setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped\\ninstead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to\\ndelude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our\\npassions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our\\ninclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run\\nupon our destruction by our own choice.\\n\\nI found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about\\nthe devil as it was about the being of a God. Nature assisted all my\\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,\\nan overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of\\nthe equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the\\nlike; but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil\\nspirit, of his origin, his being, his nature, and above all, of his\\ninclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor\\ncreature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural\\nand innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking\\na great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion\\nto sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as\\nHe had made us all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment;\\nand he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After this\\nI had been telling him how the devil was God s enemy in the hearts of\\nmen, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of\\nProvidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the\\nlike.  Well,  says Friday,  but you say God is so strong, so great; is\\nHe not much strong, much might as the devil?   Yes, yes,  says I,\\n Friday; God is stronger than the devil God is above the devil, and\\ntherefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable\\nus to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts.   But,  says\\nhe again,  if God much stronger, much might as the wicked devil, why\\nGod no kill the devil, so make him no more do wicked?  I was strangely\\nsurprised at this question; and, after all, though I was now an old\\nman, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist or a\\nsolver of difficulties; and at first I could not tell what to say; so I\\npretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too\\nearnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in\\nthe very same broken words as above. By this time I had recovered\\nmyself a little, and I said,  God will at last punish him severely; he\\nis reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless\\npit, to dwell with everlasting fire.  This did not satisfy Friday; but\\nhe returns upon me, repeating my words,  _Reserve at last_!  me no\\nunderstand but why not kill the devil now; not kill great ago?   You\\nmay as well ask me,  said I,  why God does not kill you or me, when we\\ndo wicked things here that offend Him we are preserved to repent and be\\npardoned.  He mused some time on this.  Well, well,  says he, mighty\\naffectionately,  that well so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve,\\nrepent, God pardon all.  Here I was run down again by him to the last\\ndegree; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,\\nthough they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,\\nand of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the\\nconsequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form\\nthe knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us; of a\\nMediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of\\nGod s throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form\\nthese in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and\\nSaviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God,\\npromised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely\\nnecessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of\\nGod and the means of salvation.\\n\\nI therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man,\\nrising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then\\nsending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God\\nthat He would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage;\\nassisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to\\nreceive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to\\nHimself, and would guide me so to speak to him from the Word of God\\nthat his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul\\nsaved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with\\nhim upon the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the\\nworld, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from Heaven, viz. of\\nrepentance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then\\nexplained to him as well as I could why our blessed Redeemer took not\\non Him the nature of angels but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that\\nreason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that He came\\nonly to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.\\n\\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I\\ntook for this poor creature s instruction, and must acknowledge, what I\\nbelieve all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying\\nthings open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many\\nthings that either I did not know or had not fully considered before,\\nbut which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for\\nthe information of this poor savage; and I had more affection in my\\ninquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so\\nthat, whether this poor wild wretch was better for me or no, I had\\ngreat reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat\\nlighter, upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure:\\nand when I reflected that in this solitary life which I have been\\nconfined to, I had not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and\\nto seek the Hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made an\\ninstrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew,\\nthe soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of\\nreligion and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ\\nJesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all these\\nthings, a secret joy ran through every part of My soul, and I\\nfrequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had\\nso often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could\\npossibly have befallen me.\\n\\nI continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and\\nthe conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was\\nsuch as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly\\nand completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be\\nformed in a sublunary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a\\nmuch better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it,\\nthat we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We\\nhad here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to\\ninstruct than if we had been in England. I always applied myself, in\\nreading the Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning\\nof what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries and\\nquestionings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the\\nScripture knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere private\\nreading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also, from\\nexperience in this retired part of my life, viz. how infinite and\\ninexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the\\ndoctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the\\nWord of God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare\\nreading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my\\nduty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance\\nfor my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a\\nstated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God s commands,\\nand this without any teacher or instructor, I mean human; so the same\\nplain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage\\ncreature, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few\\nequal to him in my life.\\n\\nAs to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have\\nhappened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines or\\nschemes of church government, they were all perfectly useless to us,\\nand, for aught I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the\\nworld. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God; and we\\nhad, blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching\\nand instructing by His word, leading us into all truth, and making us\\nboth willing and obedient to the instruction of His word. And I cannot\\nsee the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of\\nreligion, which have made such confusion in the world, would have been\\nto us, if we could have obtained it. But I must go on with the\\nhistorical part of things, and take every part in its order.\\n\\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could\\nunderstand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though\\nin broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at\\nleast so much of it as related to my coming to this place: how I had\\nlived there, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such it was\\nto him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave\\nhim a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a\\nbelt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in;\\nand in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was\\nnot only as good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon\\nother occasions.\\n\\nI described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I\\ncame from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one\\nanother, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave\\nhim an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed\\nhim, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all\\nbeaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat,\\nwhich we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole\\nstrength then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing\\nthis boat, Friday stood, musing a great while, and said nothing. I\\nasked him what it was he studied upon. At last says he,  Me see such\\nboat like come to place at my nation.  I did not understand him a good\\nwhile; but at last, when I had examined further into it, I understood\\nby him that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the\\ncountry where he lived: that is, as he explained it, was driven thither\\nby stress of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must\\nhave been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and\\ndrive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of men making\\ntheir escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so\\nI only inquired after a description of the boat.\\n\\nFriday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to\\nunderstand him when he added with some warmth,  We save the white mans\\nfrom drown.  Then I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he\\ncalled them, in the boat.  Yes,  he said;  the boat full of white\\nmans.  I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I\\nasked him then what became of them. He told me,  They live, they dwell\\nat my nation. \\n\\nThis put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these\\nmight be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight\\nof my island, as I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on\\nthe rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in\\ntheir boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.\\nUpon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them. He\\nassured me they lived still there; that they had been there about four\\nyears; that the savages left them alone, and gave them victuals to live\\non. I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat\\nthem. He said,  No, they make brother with them;  that is, as I\\nunderstood him, a truce; and then he added,  They no eat mans but when\\nmake the war fight;  that is to say, they never eat any men but such as\\ncome to fight with them and are taken in battle.\\n\\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of\\nthe hill at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I\\nhad, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of America,\\nFriday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the\\nmainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and\\ncalls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what\\nwas the matter.  Oh, joy!  says he;  Oh, glad! there see my country,\\nthere my nation!  I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure\\nappeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance\\ndiscovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own\\ncountry again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into\\nme, which made me at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was\\nbefore; and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his\\nown nation again, he would not only forget all his religion but all his\\nobligation to me, and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an\\naccount of me, and come back, perhaps with a hundred or two of them,\\nand make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to\\nbe with those of his enemies when they were taken in war. But I wronged\\nthe poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry\\nafterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held some weeks, I\\nwas a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as\\nbefore: in which I was certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful\\ncreature having no thought about it but what consisted with the best\\nprinciples, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, as\\nappeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.\\n\\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day\\npumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I\\nsuspected were in him; but I found everything he said was so honest and\\nso innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and in\\nspite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again;\\nnor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I\\ncould not suspect him of deceit.\\n\\nOne day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea,\\nso that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said,\\n Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own\\nnation?   Yes,  he said,  I be much O glad to be at my own nation. \\n What would you do there?  said I.  Would you turn wild again, eat\\nmen s flesh again, and be a savage as you were before?  He looked full\\nof concern, and shaking his head, said,  No, no, Friday tell them to\\nlive good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle\\nflesh, milk; no eat man again.   Why, then,  said I to him,  they will\\nkill you.  He looked grave at that, and then said,  No, no, they no\\nkill me, they willing love learn.  He meant by this, they would be\\nwilling to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans that\\ncame in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He\\nsmiled at that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I told him I\\nwould make a canoe for him. He told me he would go if I would go with\\nhim.  I go!  says I;  why, they will eat me if I come there.   No, no, \\nsays he,  me make they no eat you; me make they much love you.  He\\nmeant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his\\nlife, and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he\\ncould, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he\\ncalled them who came on shore there in distress.\\n\\nFrom this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I\\ncould possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were\\nSpaniards and Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find\\nsome method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good\\ncompany together, better than I could from an island forty miles off\\nthe shore, alone and without help. So, after some days, I took Friday\\nto work again by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat\\nto go back to his own nation; and, accordingly, I carried him to my\\nfrigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared\\nit of water (for I always kept it sunk in water), I brought it out,\\nshowed it him, and we both went into it. I found he was a most\\ndexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift\\nagain as I could. So when he was in, I said to him,  Well, now, Friday,\\nshall we go to your nation?  He looked very dull at my saying so; which\\nit seems was because he thought the boat was too small to go so far. I\\nthen told him I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place where\\nthe first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into the\\nwater. He said that was big enough; but then, as I had taken no care of\\nit, and it had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had so\\nsplit and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me such a boat\\nwould do very well, and would carry  much enough vittle, drink, bread; \\nthis was his way of talking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. RESCUE OF PRISONERS FROM CANNIBALS\\n\\n\\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going\\nover with him to the continent that I told him we would go and make one\\nas big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word,\\nbut looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with\\nhim. He asked me again,  Why you angry mad with Friday? what me done? \\nI asked him what he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all.\\n No angry!  says he, repeating the words several times;  why send\\nFriday home away to my nation?   Why,  says I,  Friday, did not you say\\nyou wished you were there?   Yes, yes,  says he,  wish we both there;\\nno wish Friday there, no master there.  In a word, he would not think\\nof going there without me.  I go there, Friday?  says I;  what shall I\\ndo there?  He turned very quick upon me at this.  You do great deal\\nmuch good,  says he;  you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;\\nyou tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.   Alas, Friday! \\nsays I,  thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man\\nmyself.   Yes, yes,  says he,  you teachee me good, you teachee them\\ngood.   No, no, Friday,  says I,  you shall go without me; leave me\\nhere to live by myself, as I did before.  He looked confused again at\\nthat word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he\\ntakes it up hastily, and gives it to me.  What must I do with this? \\nsays I to him.  You take kill Friday,  says he.  What must kill you\\nfor?  said I again. He returns very quick What you send Friday away\\nfor? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.  This he spoke so earnestly\\nthat I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered\\nthe utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I\\ntold him then and often after, that I would never send him away from me\\nif he was willing to stay with me.\\n\\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to\\nme, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the\\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his\\nardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a\\nthing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least\\nthought or intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a\\nstrong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition\\ngathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men\\nthere; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with\\nFriday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large\\nperiagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in\\nthe island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes,\\nbut even of good, large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to\\nget one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to\\navoid the mistake I committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a\\ntree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was\\nfittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree\\nwe cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or\\nbetween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour\\nand smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out,\\nto make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools;\\nwhich, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in\\nabout a month s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome;\\nespecially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we\\ncut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this,\\nhowever, it cost us near a fortnight s time to get her along, as it\\nwere inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was\\nin, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.\\n\\nWhen she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see\\nwith what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn\\nher, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might\\nventure over in her.  Yes,  he said,  we venture over in her very well,\\nthough great blow wind.  However I had a further design that he knew\\nnothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her\\nwith an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so\\nI pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the\\nplace, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set\\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and\\norder it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had\\nold sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them\\nnow six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to\\npreserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use\\nfor them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most\\nof them were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty\\ngood, and with these I went to work; and with a great deal of pains,\\nand awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at\\nlength made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a\\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little\\nshort sprit at the top, such as usually our ships  long-boats sail\\nwith, and such as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I\\nhad to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in\\nthe first part of my story.\\n\\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and\\nfitting my masts and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a\\nsmall stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if we should turn\\nto windward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern\\nof her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew\\nthe usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself\\nwith so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though,\\nconsidering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I\\nthink it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.\\n\\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what\\nbelonged to the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how to\\npaddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a\\nrudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and\\nagain in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this\\nway or that way as the course we sailed changed; I say when he saw this\\nhe stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I\\nmade all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor,\\nexcept that of the compass I could make him understand very little. On\\nthe other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or\\nnever any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a\\ncompass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the\\nshore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to\\nstir abroad either by land or sea.\\n\\nI was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in\\nthis place; though the three last years that I had this creature with\\nme ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being\\nquite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the\\nanniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for\\nHis mercies as at first: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at\\nfirst, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies of\\nthe care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being\\neffectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression\\nupon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not\\nbe another year in this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry;\\ndigging, planting, and fencing as usual. I gathered and cured my\\ngrapes, and did every necessary thing as before.\\n\\nThe rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within\\ndoors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we\\ncould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the\\nbeginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the\\nshore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just\\nbig enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough\\nto float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam\\nacross the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay, dry as to\\nthe tide from the sea: and to keep the rain off we laid a great many\\nboughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house; and\\nthus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I\\ndesigned to make my adventure.\\n\\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design\\nreturned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage.\\nAnd the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of\\nprovisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended in a week or\\na fortnight s time to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was\\nbusy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday,\\nand bid him to go to the sea-shore and see if he could find a turtle or\\na tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of\\nthe eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he\\ncame running back, and flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that\\nfelt not the ground or the steps he set his foot on; and before I had\\ntime to speak to him he cries out to me,  O master! O master! O sorrow!\\nO bad! What s the matter, Friday?  says I.  O yonder there,  says he,\\n one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!  By this way of speaking I\\nconcluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three.\\n Well, Friday,  says I,  do not be frightened.  So I heartened him up\\nas well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\\nscared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for\\nhim, and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow\\ntrembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him\\nas well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and\\nthat they would eat me as well as him.  But,  says I,  Friday, we must\\nresolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?   Me shoot,  says he,\\n but there come many great number.   No matter for that,  said I again;\\n our guns will fright them that we do not kill.  So I asked him\\nwhether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by\\nme, and do just as I bid him. He said,  Me die when you bid die,\\nmaster.  So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I\\nhad been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left. When\\nwe had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we\\nalways carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small\\npistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\\nbrace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\\nside, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I\\ntook my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see\\nwhat I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were\\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that\\ntheir whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these\\nthree human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than,\\nas I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also that they had\\nlanded, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer\\nto my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came\\nalmost close down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman\\nerrand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that\\nI came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to\\nthem and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had\\nnow got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the\\ndram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he\\nwould die when I bid die.\\n\\nIn this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,\\nbetween us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three\\nguns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns\\nmyself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of\\nrum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and\\nbullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and\\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the\\nmeantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my\\nright hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into\\nthe wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be\\ndiscovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.\\n\\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\\nnumber, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\\nsuperior to them nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my\\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in\\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done\\nor intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token,\\nindeed, of God s having left them, with the other nations of that part\\nof the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did\\nnot call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less\\nan executioner of His justice that whenever He thought fit He would\\ntake the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish\\nthem as a people for national crimes, but that, in the meantime, it was\\nnone of my business that it was true Friday might justify it, because\\nhe was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very\\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them but I could\\nnot say the same with regard to myself. These things were so warmly\\npressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would\\nonly go and place myself near them that I might observe their barbarous\\nfeast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless\\nsomething offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I\\nwould not meddle with them.\\n\\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible\\nwariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched\\ntill I came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to\\nthem, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I\\ncalled softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at\\nthe corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if\\nhe could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came\\nimmediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed\\nthere that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of\\ntheir prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from\\nthem, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very soul\\nwithin me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the\\nbearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat.\\nI was filled with horror at the very naming of the white bearded man;\\nand going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay\\nupon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags,\\nor things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\\n\\nThere was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty\\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I\\nshould be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though\\nI was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\\nthe other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me\\na full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards.\\n\\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by\\nlimb to their fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at\\nhis feet. I turned to Friday.  Now, Friday,  said I,  do as I bid\\nthee.  Friday said he would.  Then, Friday,  says I,  do exactly as you\\nsee me do; fail in nothing.  So I set down one of the muskets and the\\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with\\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the\\nlike; then asking him if he was ready, he said,  Yes.   Then fire at\\nthem,  said I; and at the same moment I fired also.\\n\\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\\nshot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I\\nkilled one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\\nconsternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their\\nfeet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to\\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept\\nhis eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I\\ndid; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece,\\nand took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock\\nand present; he did the same again.  Are you ready, Friday?  said I.\\n Yes,  says he.  Let fly, then,  says I,  in the name of God!  and with\\nthat I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as\\nour pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small\\npistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded that\\nthey ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody,\\nand most of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly\\nafter, though not quite dead.\\n\\n Now, Friday,  says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\\nthe musket which was yet loaded,  follow me,  which he did with a great\\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,\\nand Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\\nshouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as\\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded\\nwith arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,\\nas I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they\\nsat and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with him\\nhad left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible\\nfright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of\\nthe rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step\\nforwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running\\nabout forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he\\nhad killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat,\\nthough I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of\\nthem, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the\\nboat as if he had been dead.\\n\\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He\\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\\nscarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it\\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\\npiece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was:\\nand he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for\\nhis deliverance.  Seignior,  said I, with as much Spanish as I could\\nmake up,  we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have\\nany strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.  He\\ntook them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands,\\nbut, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers\\nlike a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the\\ntruth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures\\nwere so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell\\ndown for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt\\ntheir own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was\\nthe case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of\\nthem fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the\\nfright.\\n\\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep\\nmy charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:\\nso I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we\\nfirst fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been\\ndischarged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving him my\\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them\\ncome to me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there\\nhappened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the\\nsavages, who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the\\nweapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it.\\nThe Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though\\nweak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great wounds\\non his head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in\\nwith him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword\\nout of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting\\nthe sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the\\nbody, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help\\nhim, could come near him.\\n\\nFriday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches,\\nwith no weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that he despatched\\nthose three who as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,\\nand all the rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me\\nfor a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued\\ntwo of the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to\\nrun, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,\\nand killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and\\nthough he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam\\nwith all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which\\nthree in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died\\nor no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account\\nof the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from the\\ntree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat;\\ntwo killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in\\nthe wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found\\ndropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase\\nof them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not\\ndead twenty-one in all.\\n\\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he\\nhit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\\ncanoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their\\nescape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they should come\\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by\\nmere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to\\none of their canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me: but when I\\nwas in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor creature lie\\nthere, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and\\nalmost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not\\nbeen able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard\\nneck and heels, and had been tied so long that he had really but little\\nlife in him.\\n\\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him\\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,\\nbut groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was\\nonly unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him\\nspeak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my\\nbottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of\\nhis being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when\\nFriday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have\\nmoved any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced\\nhim, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang;\\nthen cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then\\nsang and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good\\nwhile before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the\\nmatter; but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his\\nfather.\\n\\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy\\nand filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I\\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this: for he\\nwent into the boat and out of the boat a great many times: when he went\\nin to him he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his\\nfather s head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish\\nit; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with\\nthe binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,\\nperceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub\\nthem with, which did them a great deal of good.\\n\\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\\nsavages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that\\nwe did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they\\ncould be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all\\nnight, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I\\ncould not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached\\ntheir own coast.\\n\\nBut to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I could\\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought\\nhe could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping\\nand laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if\\nhe had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said,  None;\\nugly dog eat all up self.  I then gave him a cake of bread out of a\\nlittle pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself;\\nbut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my\\npocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them\\nfor his father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins but I\\nsaw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched,\\nfor he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he\\nran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;\\nand though I called, and hallooed out too after him, it was all\\none away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back\\nagain, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer I found his\\npace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up to\\nme I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring\\nhis father some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or\\nloaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his\\nfather; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The\\nwater revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given\\nhim, for he was fainting with thirst.\\n\\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any\\nwater left. He said,  Yes ; and I bade him give it to the poor\\nSpaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one\\nof the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed\\nvery weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade\\nof a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled\\nwith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon\\nFriday s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the\\nbread and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of\\nraisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and\\nthankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak,\\nnotwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could\\nnot stand up upon his feet he tried to do it two or three times, but\\nwas really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him;\\nso I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe\\nthem with rum, as he had done his father s.\\n\\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or\\nperhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if\\nhis father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;\\nand at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,\\nand, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one\\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when\\nhe came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so\\nFriday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to\\nlet Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.\\nBut Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back,\\nand carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side\\nor gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then\\nlifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently\\nstepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the\\nshore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too;\\nso he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the\\nboat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to\\nhim, and asked him whither he went. He told me,  Go fetch more boat; \\nso away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like\\nhim; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to\\nit by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests\\nout of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to\\nwalk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\\n\\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind\\nof hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\\ntogether upon it between us.\\n\\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them\\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again,\\nand Friday and I, in about two hours  time, made a very handsome tent,\\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in\\nthe space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of\\nyoung wood which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such\\nthings as I had viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to\\nlie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.\\n\\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king\\nI looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that\\nI had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were\\nperfectly subjected I was absolutely lord and lawgiver they all owed\\ntheir lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had\\nbeen occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three\\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions my man Friday was\\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\\nwas a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\\ndominions. But this is by the way.\\n\\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them\\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made\\nthem a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I\\ncooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I\\ncarried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for\\nthem, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as\\nI could, cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter,\\nespecially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the\\nSpaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.\\n\\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\\nthe canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for\\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I\\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him\\nto bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not\\nthink of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that\\nway; all which he punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance\\nof the savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce\\nknow where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to\\nthe place.\\n\\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\\nsubjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we\\nmight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.\\nHis first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live\\nout the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of\\nnecessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they\\nwere as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were\\ncast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he\\nsaid he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully\\nfrightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the\\nfire, that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed\\nby thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two\\nwhich appeared viz. Friday and I were two heavenly spirits, or furies,\\ncome down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he\\nknew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to\\nanother; for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could\\ndart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting\\nup the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the right;\\nfor, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages never attempted\\nto go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with the\\naccounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the\\nsea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be\\ndestroyed with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and\\ntherefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept\\nalways upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of\\nus, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open\\nfield, at any time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. VISIT OF MUTINEERS\\n\\n\\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\\ncoming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to\\nthe main into consideration; being likewise assured by Friday s father\\nthat I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account,\\nif I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a\\nserious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there\\nwere sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been\\ncast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace,\\nindeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,\\nand, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage,\\nand found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to\\nthe Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was\\nchiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they\\ncould meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,\\nwhom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men were\\ndrowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through\\ninfinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the\\ncannibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every moment.\\nHe told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly\\nuseless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the\\nsea having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at\\ntheir first landing to provide themselves with some food.\\n\\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had\\nformed any design of making their escape. He said they had many\\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor tools to\\nbuild one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in\\ntears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a\\nproposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if\\nthey were all here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I\\nfeared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in\\ntheir hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of\\nman, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they\\nhad received so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I\\ntold him it would be very hard that I should be made the instrument of\\ntheir deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their\\nprisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a\\nsacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither;\\nand that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured\\nalive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be\\ncarried into the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded,\\nif they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a barque\\nlarge enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or\\nto the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital,\\nthey should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force\\namong their own people, I might be ill-used for my kindness to them,\\nand make my case worse than it was before.\\n\\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that\\nhe believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he\\nwould go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,\\nand return again and bring me their answer; that he would make\\nconditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be\\nabsolutely under my direction as their commander and captain; and they\\nshould swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and\\ngo to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to\\nbe directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed\\nsafely in such country as I intended, and that he would bring a\\ncontract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told\\nme he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me\\nas long as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take my\\nside to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least\\nbreach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them\\nvery civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest distress\\nimaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at\\nthe mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever\\nreturning to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would\\nundertake their relief, they would live and die by me.\\n\\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to\\ntreat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard\\nhimself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one\\nhand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be\\nvery well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance\\nof his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus: he had\\nbeen with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in\\nwhat manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my\\nsupport; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid\\nup; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was\\nnot sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was\\nincreased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his\\ncountrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come\\nover; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if\\nwe should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of\\nAmerica; so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him\\nand the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could\\nspare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we\\nmight have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;\\nfor want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think\\nthemselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into\\nanother.  You know,  says he,  the children of Israel, though they\\nrejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled\\neven against God Himself, that delivered them, when they came to want\\nbread in the wilderness. \\n\\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\\nwith his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as\\nthe wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a\\nmonth s time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much\\nland cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley\\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had\\nto spare: indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food\\nfor the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say\\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not\\nto be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\\n\\nHaving now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us\\nout of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had\\nbeen very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\\noccasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it\\nwas impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.\\nFor this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for\\nour work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I\\ncaused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to\\noversee and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable\\npains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to\\ndo the like, till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak,\\nnear two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four\\ninches thick: what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.\\n\\nAt the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats\\nas much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard\\ngo out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our\\nturns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up\\nwith the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and\\nadded them to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the\\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in\\nthe sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of\\nthe sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and\\nthese, with our bread, formed a great part of our food very good living\\ntoo, I assure you, for they are exceedingly nourishing.\\n\\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most\\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was\\nenough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we\\nbrought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and\\nthe like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food\\nto the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore\\nwith me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very\\nplentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of\\nthe world; that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed\\nand secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more\\nwicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard\\nwas very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I\\ndid not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no\\nneed of it.\\n\\nAnd now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\\nwith those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not\\nto bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself\\nand the old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or\\nattack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to\\nsend for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand\\nby him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went\\nwould be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this\\nshould be put in writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to\\nhave done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a\\nquestion which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard\\nand the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the\\ncanoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought\\nin, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave\\neach of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges\\nof powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and\\nnot to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.\\n\\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view\\nof my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them\\nprovisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for\\nmany days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days \\ntime; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them\\nabout a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should\\nknow them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on\\nshore. They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at\\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it\\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\\nsure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my\\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\\n\\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange\\nand unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps,\\nbeen heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,\\nwhen my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud,  Master,\\nmaster, they are come, they are come!  I jumped up, and regardless of\\ndanger I went, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little\\ngrove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick\\nwood; I say, regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not\\nmy custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea,\\nI presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing\\nin for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and\\nthe wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed,\\npresently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay\\non, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called\\nFriday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we\\nlooked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or\\nenemies. In the next place I went in to fetch my perspective glass to\\nsee what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I\\nclimbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was\\napprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer without being\\ndiscovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my eye plainly\\ndiscovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half\\ndistance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the\\nshore. By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and\\nthe boat appeared to be an English long-boat.\\n\\nI cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a\\nship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own\\ncountrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;\\nbut yet I had some secret doubts hung about me I cannot tell from\\nwhence they came bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it\\noccurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in\\nthat part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of\\nthe world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been\\nno storms to drive them in there in distress; and that if they were\\nreally English it was most probable that they were here upon no good\\ndesign; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the\\nhands of thieves and murderers.\\n\\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which\\nsometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of\\nits being real. That such hints and notices are given us I believe few\\nthat have made any observation of things can deny; that they are\\ncertain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits,\\nwe cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of\\ndanger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent\\n(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question),\\nand that they are given for our good?\\n\\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\\ncome it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far\\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept\\nmyself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as\\nif they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of\\nlanding; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not\\nsee the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their\\nboat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was\\nvery happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my\\ndoor, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and\\nperhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore I was\\nfully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two\\nI thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven\\nmen, whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought,\\nbound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,\\nthey took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I\\ncould perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,\\naffliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two,\\nI could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared\\nconcerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was\\nperfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it\\nshould be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could,  O\\nmaster! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans. \\n Why, Friday,  says I,  do you think they are going to eat them, then? \\n Yes,  says Friday,  they will eat them.   No no,  says I,  Friday; I\\nam afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure they will\\nnot eat them. \\n\\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but\\nstood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment\\nwhen the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the\\nvillains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it,\\nor sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall\\nevery moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in\\nmy veins. I wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that\\nhad gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered\\nwithin shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, for I saw\\nno firearms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another\\nway. After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the\\ninsolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the\\nisland, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three\\nother men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down\\nall three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in\\ndespair. This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore,\\nand began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly\\nI looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged\\nin the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I\\nknew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the\\nprovidential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and\\ntide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported; so\\nthese three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance\\nand supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and\\nreally they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they\\nthought themselves lost and their case desperate. So little do we see\\nbefore us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully\\nupon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures\\nso absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have\\nalways something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer\\ndeliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their\\ndeliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their\\ndestruction.\\n\\nIt was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while\\nthey rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had\\ncarelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed\\nconsiderably away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in\\nthe boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much\\nbrandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than\\nthe other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it,\\nhallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they\\nall soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch\\nher, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft\\noozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true\\nseamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to\\nforethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the\\ncountry again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling\\nthem off from the boat,  Why, let her alone, Jack, can t you? she ll\\nfloat next tide;  by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of\\nwhat countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not\\nonce daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place of\\nobservation near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to think how\\nwell it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the\\nboat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might\\nbe at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse,\\nif they had any. In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle as\\nbefore, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind\\nof enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an\\nexcellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took\\nmyself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure,\\nindeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with\\nthe great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols\\nin my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\\n\\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it\\nwas dark; but about two o clock, being the heat of the day, I found\\nthat they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought,\\nlaid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for\\ntheir condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the\\nshelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as\\nI thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to\\ndiscover myself to them, and learn something of their condition;\\nimmediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind\\nme, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a\\nspectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I\\ncould, and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in\\nSpanish,  What are ye, gentlemen?  They started up at the noise, but\\nwere ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure\\nthat I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them\\njust going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.\\n Gentlemen,  said I,  do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have a\\nfriend near when you did not expect it.   He must be sent directly from\\nheaven then,  said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his\\nhat at the same time to me;  for our condition is past the help of\\nman.   All help is from heaven, sir,  said I,  but can you put a\\nstranger in the way to help you? for you seem to be in some great\\ndistress. I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make\\napplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up\\nhis sword to kill you. \\n\\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\\nlike one astonished, returned,  Am I talking to God or man? Is it a\\nreal man or an angel?   Be in no fear about that, sir,  said I;  if God\\nhad sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed,\\nand armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your\\nfears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I\\nhave one servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can\\nwe serve you? What is your case?   Our case, sir,  said he,  is too\\nlong to tell you while our murderers are so near us; but, in short,\\nsir, I was commander of that ship my men have mutinied against me; they\\nhave been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set\\nme on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me one my\\nmate, the other a passenger where we expected to perish, believing the\\nplace to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.   Where\\nare these brutes, your enemies?  said I;  do you know where they are\\ngone?   There they lie, sir,  said he, pointing to a thicket of trees;\\n my heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if\\nthey have, they will certainly murder us all.   Have they any\\nfirearms?  said I. He answered,  They had only two pieces, one of which\\nthey left in the boat.   Well, then,  said I,  leave the rest to me; I\\nsee they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but\\nshall we rather take them prisoners?  He told me there were two\\ndesperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy\\nto; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to\\ntheir duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at\\nthat distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything\\nI would direct.  Well,  says I,  let us retreat out of their view or\\nhearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.  So they\\nwillingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.\\n\\n Look you, sir,  said I,  if I venture upon your deliverance, are you\\nwilling to make two conditions with me?  He anticipated my proposals by\\ntelling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly\\ndirected and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not\\nrecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world\\nsoever I would send him; and the two other men said the same.  Well, \\nsays I,  my conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this\\nisland with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I\\nput arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to\\nme, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the\\nmeantime be governed by my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may\\nbe recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free. \\n\\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could\\ndevise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and\\nbesides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions\\nas long as he lived.  Well, then,  said I,  here are three muskets for\\nyou, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be\\ndone.  He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,\\nbut offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was very\\nhard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to\\nfire on them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the\\nfirst volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it\\nwholly upon God s providence to direct the shot. He said, very\\nmodestly, that he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that\\nthose two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all\\nthe mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still,\\nfor they would go on board and bring the whole ship s company, and\\ndestroy us all.  Well, then,  says I,  necessity legitimates my advice,\\nfor it is the only way to save our lives.  However, seeing him still\\ncautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and\\nmanage as they found convenient.\\n\\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\\nafter we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them\\nwere the heads of the mutiny? He said,  No.   Well, then,  said I,  you\\nmay let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on\\npurpose to save themselves. Now,  says I,  if the rest escape you, it\\nis your fault.  Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him\\nin his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him,\\nwith each a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going\\nfirst made some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned\\nabout, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late\\nthen, for the moment he cried out they fired I mean the two men, the\\ncaptain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their\\nshot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and\\nthe other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his\\nfeet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain\\nstepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should\\ncall upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him\\ndown with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there\\nwere three more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded.\\nBy this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it\\nwas in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them he\\nwould spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their\\nabhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to\\nbe faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying\\nher back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the\\nprotestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was\\nwilling to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not\\nagainst, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while\\nthey were on the island.\\n\\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain s mate to the boat\\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which\\nthey did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for\\nthem) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and\\nseeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror,\\nthey submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\\n\\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one\\nanother s circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,\\nwhich he heard with an attention even to amazement and particularly at\\nthe wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and\\nammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,\\nit affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself,\\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his\\nlife, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.\\nAfter this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men\\ninto my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the\\ntop of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,\\nand showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long\\ninhabiting that place.\\n\\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above\\nall, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now\\nplanted nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in\\nEngland, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in\\nany part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little\\nwinding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my\\nresidence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,\\nwhither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too\\nanother time; but at present our business was to consider how to\\nrecover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was\\nperfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still\\nsix-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed\\nconspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,\\nwould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,\\nknowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows\\nas soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and\\nthat, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a\\nnumber as we were.\\n\\nI mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very\\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on\\nspeedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\\nsurprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon\\nthis, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship s\\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat,\\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and\\nthat then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:\\nthis he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing\\nwe had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that\\nthey might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave\\nher so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly, we went on\\nboard, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever\\nelse we found there which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a\\nfew biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a\\npiece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very\\nwelcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none\\nleft for many years.\\n\\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail,\\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great\\nhole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us,\\nyet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my\\nthoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,\\nthat if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to\\nmake her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon\\nour friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my\\nthoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE SHIP RECOVERED\\n\\n\\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would\\nnot float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in\\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what\\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her\\nensign as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stirred;\\nand they fired several times, making other signals for the boat. At\\nlast, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they\\nfound the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses,\\nhoist another boat out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they\\napproached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they\\nhad firearms with them.\\n\\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view\\nof them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because\\nthe tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they\\nrowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had\\nlanded, and where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full\\nview of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all\\nthe men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest\\nfellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,\\nbeing over-powered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who\\nit seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were\\nas outrageous as any of the ship s crew, and were no doubt made\\ndesperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was\\nthat they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him\\nthat men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that\\nseeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which\\nwe were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,\\nwhether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him\\nwhat he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a\\ndeliverance were not worth venturing for?  And where, sir,  said I,  is\\nyour belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,\\nwhich elevated you a little while ago? For my part,  said I,  there\\nseems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.   What is\\nthat?  say he.  Why,  said I,  it is, that as you say there are three\\nor four honest fellows among them which should be spared, had they been\\nall of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God s\\nprovidence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for\\ndepend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die\\nor live as they behave to us.  As I spoke this with a raised voice and\\ncheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set\\nvigorously to our business.\\n\\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat s coming from the ship,\\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured\\nthem effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured\\nthan ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men,\\nto my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being\\nheard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they\\ncould have delivered themselves. Here they left them bound, but gave\\nthem provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to\\ngive them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted\\ntheir escape they should be put to death without mercy. They promised\\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over\\nthem at the entrance.\\n\\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\\nindeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other\\ntwo were taken into my service, upon the captain s recommendation, and\\nupon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and\\nthe three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt\\nwe should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest\\nmen among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other\\nboat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore,\\nhauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was\\nafraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance\\nfrom the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should\\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they\\ndid, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were\\nunder a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was\\nin her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while\\nupon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all\\ntheir might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all\\nwas to no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a\\nvolley of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made\\nthe woods ring. But it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure,\\ncould not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well\\nenough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at\\nthe surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved\\nto go all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men\\nwere all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they\\nimmediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.\\n\\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this,\\nbelieving they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving\\ntheir comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,\\nwhich he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as\\nmuch frightened the other way.\\n\\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them\\nall coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,\\nwhich it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in\\nthe boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to\\nlook for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now\\nwe were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore\\nwould be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they\\nwould row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to\\nweigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.\\nHowever we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things\\nmight present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained\\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to\\nan anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at\\nthem in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,\\nmarching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation\\nlay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.\\nWe should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so\\nthat we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther\\noff, that we might come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of\\nthe hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods,\\nwhich lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest,\\nthey shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it\\nseems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they\\nsat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit to\\nhave gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had\\ndone the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger\\nto venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger\\nwas they had to fear.\\n\\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\\nthem just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.\\nI liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough\\nto come up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this\\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute\\nwhat course to take. At length I told them there would be nothing done,\\nin my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the\\nboat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore,\\nand so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on\\nshore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their\\nremoving; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw\\nthem all start up and march down towards the sea; it seems they had\\nsuch dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they\\nresolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for\\nlost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\\n\\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be\\nas it really was that they had given over their search, and were going\\nback again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was\\nready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a\\nstratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a\\ntittle. I ordered Friday and the captain s mate to go over the little\\ncreek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when\\nFriday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round,\\nat about half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they\\ncould, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as\\never they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again;\\nand then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the\\nothers hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the\\nwoods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I\\ndirected them.\\n\\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed;\\nand they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore\\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the\\ncreek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called\\nfor the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When\\nthey had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a\\ngood way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land,\\nthey took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and\\nleft only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little\\ntree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving\\nFriday and the captain s mate to their business, I took the rest with\\nme; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two\\nmen before they were aware one of them lying on the shore, and the\\nother being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and\\nwaking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in\\nupon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat\\nto yield, or he was a dead man. They needed very few arguments to\\npersuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his\\ncomrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who\\nwere not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore\\nwas easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very\\nsincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain s mate so\\nwell managed their business with the rest that they drew them, by\\nhallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to\\nanother, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where\\nthey were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it\\nwas dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the\\ntime they came back to us.\\n\\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours\\nafter Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and\\nwe could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up,\\ncalling to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer,\\nand complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any\\nfaster: which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to\\nthe boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion when they\\nfound the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their\\ntwo men gone. We could hear them call one to another in a most\\nlamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted\\nisland; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all\\nbe murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they\\nshould be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and\\ncalled their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no\\nanswer. After some time we could see them, by the little light there\\nwas, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes\\nthey would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come\\nashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.\\nMy men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once\\nin the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to\\nspare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was\\nunwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others\\nwere very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not\\nseparate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade\\nnearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands\\nand feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be\\ndiscovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they\\noffered to fire.\\n\\nThey had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the\\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them,\\nwith two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this\\nprincipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have\\npatience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only\\nheard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and\\nFriday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was\\nkilled upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and fell just\\nby him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third\\nran for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my\\nwhole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo;\\nFriday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the\\nthree prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon\\nthem, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I\\nmade the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call\\nthem by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps\\nmight reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for\\nindeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be\\nvery willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one\\nof them,  Tom Smith! Tom Smith!  Tom Smith answered immediately,  Is\\nthat Robinson?  for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered,\\n Ay, ay; for God s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or\\nyou are all dead men this moment.   Who must we yield to? Where are\\nthey?  says Smith again.  Here they are,  says he;  here s our captain\\nand fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours; the\\nboatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if\\nyou do not yield you are all lost.   Will they give us quarter, then? \\nsays Tom Smith,  and we will yield.   I ll go and ask, if you promise\\nto yield,  said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain\\nhimself then calls out,  You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down\\nyour arms immediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but\\nWill Atkins. \\n\\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out,  For God s sake, captain, give me\\nquarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I:  which, by\\nthe way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man\\nthat laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him\\nbarbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.\\nHowever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,\\nand trust to the governor s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all\\ncalled me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged\\ntheir lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two\\nmore, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,\\nwith those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,\\nand upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight\\nfor reasons of state.\\n\\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship:\\nand as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him,\\nand upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it\\nmust bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the\\ngallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their\\nlives. As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the\\ncommander s of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore\\nin a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct\\nthem that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman;\\nthat he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given\\nthem all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be\\ndealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\\nwould be hanged in the morning.\\n\\nThough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\\neffect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with\\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God s\\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\\n\\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and\\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\\ncalled the captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the\\nmen was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain,  Captain, the\\ncommander calls for you;  and presently the captain replied,  Tell his\\nexcellency I am just coming.  This more perfectly amazed them, and they\\nall believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men. Upon\\nthe captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship,\\nwhich he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution\\nthe next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be\\nsecure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he\\nshould go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send\\nthem pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was committed to\\nFriday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They\\nconveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal\\nplace, especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my\\nbower, as I called it, of which I have given a full description: and as\\nit was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,\\nconsidering they were upon their behaviour.\\n\\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he\\nthought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the\\nship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they\\nwere brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter\\nfor their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to\\nEngland they would all be hanged in chains; but that if they would join\\nin so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the\\ngovernor s engagement for their pardon.\\n\\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men\\nin their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and\\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and\\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a\\nfather to them as long as they lived.  Well,  says the captain,  I must\\ngo and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring\\nhim to consent to it.  So he brought me an account of the temper he\\nfound them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.\\nHowever, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back\\nagain and choose out those five, and tell them, that they might see he\\ndid not want men, that he would take out those five to be his\\nassistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and the\\nthree that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for\\nthe fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the\\nexecution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the\\nshore. This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in\\nearnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it\\nwas now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to\\npersuade the other five to do their duty.\\n\\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the\\ncaptain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the\\nfirst gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had\\ngiven their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third, the other two\\nthat I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain s\\nmotion had now released; fourth, these five released at last; so that\\nthere were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave\\nfor hostages.\\n\\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\\nboard the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries;\\nand I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\\nFriday was to take them.\\n\\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;\\nand that it was the governor s pleasure they should not stir anywhere\\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the\\ncastle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see\\nme as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\\n\\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well,\\nfor they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came\\nwithin call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they\\nhad brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time\\nbefore they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till\\nthey came to the ship s side; when the captain and the mate entering\\nfirst with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and\\ncarpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully\\nseconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the\\nmain and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them\\ndown that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering at\\nthe forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle\\nwhich went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there\\nprisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain\\nordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where\\nthe new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and\\nwith two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when the\\nmate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men\\nfired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which\\nbroke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The\\nmate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded\\nas he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the head,\\nthe bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his\\nears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,\\nand the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.\\n\\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\\nhis success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having\\nsat watching upon the shore for it till near two o clock in the\\nmorning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it\\nhaving been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I\\nwas surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I\\nheard a man call me by the name of  Governor! Governor!  and presently\\nI knew the captain s voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill,\\nthere he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms,\\n My dear friend and deliverer,  says he,  there s your ship; for she is\\nall yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.  I cast my eyes\\nto the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of\\nthe shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters\\nof her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just\\nagainst the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the\\ncaptain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first\\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to\\nsink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly\\nput into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to\\ncarry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was\\nnot able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I\\nheld fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived\\nthe surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and\\ngave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.\\nAfter I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought\\nme to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to\\nhim. All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only\\nnot under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender\\nthings to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood\\nof joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last\\nit broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my\\nspeech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we\\nrejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven\\nto deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\\neye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the\\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not\\nto lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could\\nforbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided\\nfor me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from\\nwhom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.\\n\\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this,\\nhe called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore\\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\\nbeen one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had\\nbeen to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of\\nbottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira\\nwine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good\\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship s beef, and six pieces of pork,\\nwith a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also\\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and\\ntwo bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But besides\\nthese, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me\\nsix new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one\\npair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit\\nof clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word,\\nhe clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable\\npresent, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never\\nwas anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and\\nuneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.\\n\\nAfter these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were\\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be\\ndone with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we\\nmight venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom\\nhe knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the\\ncaptain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging\\nthem, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as\\nmalefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English\\ncolony he could come to; and I found that the captain himself was very\\nanxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would\\nundertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request\\nthat he should leave them upon the island.  I should be very glad of\\nthat,  says the captain,  with all my heart.   Well,  says I,  I will\\nsend for them up and talk with them for you.  So I caused Friday and\\nthe two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having\\nperformed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and\\nbring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep\\nthem there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my\\nnew habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the\\ncaptain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told\\nthem I had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to the\\ncaptain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to\\ncommit further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in\\ntheir own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had\\ndug for others. I let them know that by my direction the ship had been\\nseized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that\\ntheir new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that\\nthey would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted\\nto know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates\\ntaken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had\\nauthority so to do.\\n\\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\\nsay but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their\\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not\\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to\\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England\\nother than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running\\naway with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know,\\nwould be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them,\\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they\\ndesired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some\\ninclination to give them their lives, if they thought they could shift\\non shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much\\nrather venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged.\\nSo I left it on that issue.\\n\\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he\\ndurst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\\nseeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my\\nword; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set\\nthem at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might\\ntake them again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very\\nthankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire\\ninto the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them\\nsome firearms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should\\nlive very well if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board\\nthe ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my\\nthings, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all\\nright in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering\\nhim, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be\\nhanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.\\n\\nWhen the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.\\nI told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\\nhad carried them away they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the\\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\\nnothing less to expect.\\n\\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them\\nI would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into\\nthe way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole\\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I\\ntold them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be\\nexpected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them\\nin common with themselves. Here it may be noted that the captain, who\\nhad ink on board, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of\\nmaking ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done\\nthings much more difficult.\\n\\nI left them my firearms viz. five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and\\nthree swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after\\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a\\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them\\nevery part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the\\ncaptain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some\\ngarden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of. Also, I\\ngave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and\\nbade them be sure to sow and increase them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. RETURN TO ENGLAND\\n\\n\\nHaving done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the\\nship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.\\nThe next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship s\\nside, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three,\\nbegged to be taken into the ship for God s sake, for they should be\\nmurdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though he\\nhanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pretended to have no\\npower without me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn\\npromises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time\\nafter, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest\\nand quiet fellows.\\n\\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling\\nthem that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I\\nwould not forget them.\\n\\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the\\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots;\\nalso, I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had\\nlain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and\\ncould hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and\\nhandled, as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.\\nAnd thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the\\nship s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it\\neight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered\\nfrom this second captivity the same day of the month that I first made\\nmy escape in the long-boat from among the Moors of Sallee. In this\\nvessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in\\nthe year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.\\n\\nWhen I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as\\nif I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward,\\nwhom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great\\nmisfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very\\nlow in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring\\nher I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for\\nher former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little\\nstock would afford; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do\\nbut little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former\\nkindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her,\\nas shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterwards into\\nYorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family\\nextinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of\\none of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,\\nthere had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found\\nnothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would\\nnot do much for me as to settling in the world.\\n\\nI met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and\\nthis was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,\\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives\\nof the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other\\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome\\ncompliment upon the subject, and a present of almost  200 sterling.\\n\\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some\\ninformation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what\\nwas become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years\\npast given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,\\nwhere I arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very\\nhonestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant\\nupon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and\\nto my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship\\nwho first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown\\nold, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far\\nfrom a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.\\nThe old man did not know me, and indeed I hardly knew him. But I soon\\nbrought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his\\nremembrance, when I told him who I was.\\n\\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old\\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but\\nthat he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living,\\nbut the trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my\\npart were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very\\ngood account of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the\\ngeneral belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given\\nin the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the\\nprocurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to\\nclaim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St.\\nAugustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the\\nconversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I\\nappeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be\\nrestored; only that the improvement, or annual production, being\\ndistributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured\\nme that the steward of the king s revenue from lands, and the\\nprovidore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along\\nthat the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a\\nfaithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my\\nmoiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had\\nbrought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth\\nlooking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any\\nobstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he\\ncould not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but\\nthis he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the\\nenjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he\\nhad heard that the king s third of my part, which was, it seems,\\ngranted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to\\nabove two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a\\nquiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my\\npartner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also\\nenrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the\\nsurvivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very\\nwealthy; and he believed I would not only have their assistance for\\nputting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of\\nmoney in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm\\nwhile their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as\\nabove; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\\n\\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees\\nshould thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my\\nwill, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\\n\\nHe told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\\ndead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should\\ncome of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with\\na thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put\\nin his claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or\\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the\\ningenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was\\nnow at the Brazils, orders to do it.  But,  says the old man,  I have\\none piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable\\nto you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the\\nworld believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account\\nwith me, in your name, for the first six or eight years  profits, which\\nI received. There being at that time great disbursements for increasing\\nthe works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to\\nnear so much as afterwards it produced; however,  says the old man,  I\\nshall give you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I\\nhave disposed of it. \\n\\nAfter a few days  further conference with this ancient friend, he\\nbrought me an account of the first six years  income of my plantation,\\nsigned by my partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered\\nin goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum,\\nmolasses, &c., which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by\\nthis account, that every year the income considerably increased; but,\\nas above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small:\\nhowever, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred\\nand seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen\\ndouble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been\\nshipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having\\nthe place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and\\nhow he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses,\\nand buy him a share in a new ship.  However, my old friend,  says he,\\n you shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son\\nreturns you shall be fully satisfied.  Upon this he pulls out an old\\npouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold;\\nand giving the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was\\ngone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter-part owner, and his son\\nanother, he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.\\n\\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to\\nbe able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he\\nhad taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all\\noccasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I\\ncould hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I\\nasked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at\\nthat time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could not\\nsay but it might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money,\\nand I might want it more than he.\\n\\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\\nthe plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I\\nafterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his\\nson s ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the\\nmoney, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but\\ncame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a\\npenny more from him.\\n\\nWhen this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a\\nmethod to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought to go\\nover to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I\\ndid not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in\\na public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\\nplanting the said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by\\na notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a\\nletter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;\\nand then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the\\nreturn.\\n\\nNever was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this\\nprocuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet\\nfrom the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I\\nwent to sea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers\\nenclosed: \\n\\nFirst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or\\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old\\nPortugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one\\nthousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.\\n\\nSecondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the\\neffects in their hands, before the government claimed the\\nadministration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which\\nthey called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the\\nplantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and\\nforty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and forty\\nmoidores.\\n\\nThirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine s account, who had\\nreceived the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to\\naccount for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly\\ndeclared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed,\\nwhich he acknowledged to my account: as to the king s part, that\\nrefunded nothing.\\n\\nThere was a letter of my partner s, congratulating me very\\naffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate\\nwas improved, and what it produced a year; with the particulars of the\\nnumber of squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many\\nslaves there were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for\\nblessings, told me he had said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the\\nBlessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come\\nover and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him\\norders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself;\\nconcluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his\\nfamily; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards  skins, which he\\nhad, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had\\nsent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He\\nsent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces\\nof gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my\\ntwo merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of\\nsugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole\\naccount in gold.\\n\\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better\\nthan the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my\\nvery heart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships\\ncome all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my\\ngoods: and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came\\nto my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the\\nold man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of\\njoy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I\\ncontinued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent\\nfor, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he\\nordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well:\\nbut I verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that\\nmanner to the spirits, I should have died.\\n\\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds\\nsterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the\\nBrazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of\\nlands in England: and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce\\nknew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of\\nit. The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my\\ngood old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress,\\nkind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him\\nall that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of\\nHeaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now\\nlay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first\\nreturned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent\\nfor a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge\\nfrom the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged\\nhe owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which I\\ncaused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of\\nthe annual profits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to\\naccount with him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in\\nmy name; and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred\\nmoidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty\\nmoidores a year to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited\\nmy old man.\\n\\nI had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do\\nwith the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and,\\nindeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life\\nin the island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing\\nbut what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my\\nbusiness was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide my money\\nin, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew\\nmouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the\\ncontrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old\\npatron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I\\nhad. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me\\nthither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I\\nhad settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind\\nme. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was\\nhonest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but\\npoor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I\\nhad no way but to go back to England myself and take my effects with\\nme.\\n\\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and,\\ntherefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his\\nsatisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of\\nthe poor widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she,\\nwhile it was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So, the\\nfirst thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his\\ncorrespondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her\\nout, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk\\nwith her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if\\nI lived, have a further supply: at the same time I sent my two sisters\\nin the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want,\\nyet not in very good circumstances; one having been married and left a\\nwidow; and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should\\nbe. But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch\\nupon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go\\naway to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly\\nperplexed me.\\n\\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself\\nthere, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some\\nlittle scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me\\nback. However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for\\nthe present; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the\\nreligion of the country all the while I was among them, so neither did\\nI yet; only that, now and then, having of late thought more of it than\\nformerly, when I began to think of living and dying among them, I began\\nto regret having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be\\nthe best religion to die with.\\n\\nBut, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from\\ngoing to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave\\nmy effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if\\nI arrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find\\nsome relations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I\\nprepared to go to England with all my wealth.\\n\\nIn order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet\\nbeing just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just\\nand faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the\\nPrior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just\\ndealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores\\nwhich were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred\\nto the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the\\nprior should direct; desiring the good padre s prayers for me, and the\\nlike. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the\\nacknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for\\nsending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of\\nit. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the\\nimproving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of\\nthe works; giving him instructions for his future government of my\\npart, according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I\\ndesired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from\\nme more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to\\ncome to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.\\nTo this I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his\\nwife and two daughters, for such the captain s son informed me he had;\\nwith two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in\\nLisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good\\nvalue.\\n\\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my\\neffects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way\\nto go to England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I\\nhad a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and\\nyet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me\\nso much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet\\nI altered my mind, and that not once but two or three times.\\n\\nIt is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of\\nthe reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own\\nthoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled\\nout to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other,\\nhaving put my things on board one of them, and in the other having\\nagreed with the captain; I say two of these ships miscarried. One was\\ntaken by the Algerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near\\nTorbay, and all the people drowned except three; so that in either of\\nthose vessels I had been made miserable.\\n\\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I\\ncommunicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but\\neither to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to\\nRochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to\\nParis, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all\\nthe way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed\\nagainst my going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I\\nresolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste,\\nand did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to\\nmake it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son\\nof a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which\\nwe picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese\\ngentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that in all there were six\\nof us and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese,\\ncontenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge;\\nand as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,\\nbesides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of\\nsupplying the place of a servant on the road.\\n\\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well\\nmounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the\\nhonour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as\\nbecause I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole\\njourney.\\n\\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble\\nyou now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that\\nhappened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.\\n\\nWhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were\\nwilling to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth\\nobserving; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened\\naway, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we\\ncame to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the\\nway, with an account that so much snow was falling on the French side\\nof the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to\\nPampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.\\n\\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me,\\nthat had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I\\ncould scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor,\\nindeed, was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before\\nout of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot,\\nand immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very\\nkeen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing\\nand perishing of our fingers and toes.\\n\\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered\\nwith snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt\\nbefore in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it\\ncontinued snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people\\nsaid winter was come before its time; and the roads, which were\\ndifficult before, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow\\nlay in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard\\nfrozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no going\\nwithout being in danger of being buried alive every step. We stayed no\\nless than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,\\nand no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter\\nall over Europe that had been known in the memory of man) I proposed\\nthat we should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for\\nBordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering\\nthis, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on\\nthe French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out\\na guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had\\nbrought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much\\nincommoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity,\\nthey said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We\\nsent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the\\nsame way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed\\nsufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in\\nthese great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at\\nthe foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the\\nground being covered with snow. We told him we were well enough\\nprepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a\\nkind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger\\nfrom, especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied us\\nthat there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go; so\\nwe readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen\\nwith their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had\\nattempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.\\n\\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of\\nNovember; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he\\ncame directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,\\nabout twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the\\nplain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the\\ncountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning\\nto his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is\\ntrue the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many\\ntours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we\\ninsensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much\\nencumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant\\nand fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and\\nflourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way to\\npass still.\\n\\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day\\nand a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we\\nshould soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend\\nevery day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon\\nour guide, we went on.\\n\\nIt was about two hours before night when, our guide being something\\nbefore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves,\\nand after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two\\nof the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he\\nwould have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them\\nfastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such\\nviolence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his\\npistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday\\nbeing next me, I bade him ride up and see what was the matter. As soon\\nas Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the\\nother,  O master! O master!  but like a bold fellow, rode directly up\\nto the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that\\nattacked him.\\n\\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having\\nbeen used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him,\\nbut went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would\\nhave fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the\\nwolf or endangered shooting the man.\\n\\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed,\\nit alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday s pistol, we\\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few\\nas that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed\\nthis wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him\\nimmediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily\\nfastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his\\nteeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him\\ntwice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and\\nthough he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the\\ndisorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.\\n\\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday s pistol we all\\nmended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very\\ndifficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as\\nwe came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly\\nwhat had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide,\\nthough we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had\\nkilled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR\\n\\n\\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising\\nmanner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave\\nus all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the\\ngreatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,\\nand does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has\\ntwo particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions;\\nfirst, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually\\nattempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively\\nhungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being\\ncovered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle\\nwith you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give\\nhim the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step\\nout of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best\\nway is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you\\nstop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an\\naffront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a\\nbit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets\\nall other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have\\nsatisfaction in point of honour that is his first quality: the next is,\\nif he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he\\nhas his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes\\nyou.\\n\\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he\\nwas helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and\\nfrightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood;\\nand a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were\\nall a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was\\neasy to see joy and courage in the fellow s countenance.  O! O! O! \\nsays Friday, three times, pointing to him;  O master, you give me te\\nleave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh. \\n\\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased.  You fool,  says I,\\n he will eat you up. Eatee me up! eatee me up!  says Friday, twice\\nover again;  me eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay\\nhere, me show you good laugh.  So down he sits, and gets off his boots\\nin a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes\\nthey wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his\\nhorse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.\\n\\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till\\nFriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could\\nunderstand him.  Hark ye, hark ye,  says Friday,  me speakee with you. \\nWe followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of\\nthe mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was\\nplain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here\\nand there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up\\nwith him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and\\nhit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had\\nthrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday s end, for the rogue\\nwas so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,\\nand show us some laugh as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the\\nblow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long\\nstrides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a\\nhorse to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his course as\\nif he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon\\nthe bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing\\nthe bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another\\nway; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,\\nand then ran away; and I called out,  You dog! is this your making us\\nlaugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature. \\nHe heard me, and cried out,  No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you\\nget much laugh:  and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear s\\none, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great\\noak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling\\nhis pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the\\nground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The\\nbear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first\\nthing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up\\nhe scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous\\nheavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could\\nnot for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up\\nthe tree, we all rode near to him.\\n\\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of\\na large branch, and the bear got about half-way to him. As soon as the\\nbear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker,  Ha! \\nsays he to us,  now you see me teachee the bear dance:  so he began\\njumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but\\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get\\nback; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with\\nhim by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him\\nagain, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English,  What, you\\ncome no farther? pray you come farther;  so he left jumping and shaking\\nthe tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come\\na little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped\\nagain. We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and\\ncalled to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he\\ncried out earnestly,  Oh, pray! Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and\\nthen:  he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story,\\nFriday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had\\nlaughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do:\\nfor first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we\\nfound the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out\\nfar enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws\\nand feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and\\nwhat the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly:\\nfor seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be\\npersuaded to come any farther,  Well, well,  says Friday,  you no come\\nfarther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;  and upon this he\\nwent out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and\\ngently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near\\nenough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it\\nup, and stood still.  Well,  said I to him,  Friday, what will you do\\nnow? Why don t you shoot him?   No shoot,  says Friday,  no yet; me\\nshoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:  and, indeed,\\nso he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the\\nbough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him\\nevery step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree,\\nthen, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,\\ngrasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very\\nleisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot\\non the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of\\nhis piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about\\nto see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our\\nlooks, he began to laugh very loud.  So we kill bear in my country, \\nsays Friday.  So you kill them?  says I;  why, you have no guns. No, \\nsays he,  no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.  This was a good\\ndiversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very\\nmuch hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran\\nmuch in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the\\nshore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard\\nanything that filled me with so much horror.\\n\\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as\\nFriday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of\\nthis monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near\\nthree leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and\\nwent forward on our journey.\\n\\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and\\ndangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard\\nafterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed\\nby hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in\\nthe villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great\\nmany of their sheep and horses, and some people too.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were\\nmore wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a\\nsmall plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow\\ndefile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and\\nthen we should come to the village where we were to lodge.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a\\nlittle after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with nothing in\\nthe first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which\\nwas not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the\\nroad, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of\\nsome prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone\\nout of sight in a few moments. Upon this, our guide, who, by the way,\\nwas but a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he\\nbelieved there were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and\\nour eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that\\nwood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as\\nwe came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The\\nfirst object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse\\nwhich the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we\\ncould not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had\\neaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at\\ntheir feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would have\\nlet fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found\\nwe were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware\\nof. We had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the\\nwolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and\\npresently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us,\\nall in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army\\ndrawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to\\nreceive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only\\nway; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much\\ninterval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the\\nothers, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second\\nvolley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that\\nthose that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees\\nagain, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed\\nwith a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this\\nmethod, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at\\npresent we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the\\nenemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with\\nthe fire. Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others\\nwere wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I\\nfound they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon,\\nremembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were\\nterrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as\\nloud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for\\nupon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I then ordered a\\nsecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop,\\nand away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our\\npieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had\\nbut little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness,\\nwhen we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that\\nit was farther onward, the same way we were to go.\\n\\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on\\na sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one\\nbehind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded\\nwith them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way\\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being\\nvery rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view\\nof the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the\\nfarther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming\\nnearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing\\njust at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we\\nheard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse,\\nwith a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or\\nseventeen wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of\\nthem; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we\\ndoubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but\\nthey did.\\n\\nBut here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and\\nof two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was\\nno doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just\\nby him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his\\nbody was eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what\\ncourse to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered\\nabout us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were\\nthree hundred of them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at\\nthe entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some\\nlarge timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I\\nsuppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those\\ntrees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised\\nthem all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,\\nto stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the\\ncentre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious\\ncharge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with\\na growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I\\nsaid, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey;\\nand this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their\\nseeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every\\nother man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of\\nthe wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a\\ncontinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on\\nthose before.\\n\\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they\\nstopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but\\na moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our\\npistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or\\neighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I\\nwas loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my\\nman Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest\\ndexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were\\nengaged but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of\\npowder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it\\nbe a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, when\\nthe wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an\\nuncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were\\nupon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell;\\nor rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we\\ndespatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with\\nthe light, which the night for it was now very near dark made more\\nterrible that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last\\npistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout;\\nupon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near\\ntwenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to\\ncutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the\\ncrying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so\\nthat they all fled and left us.\\n\\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it\\nbeen daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus\\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.\\nWe heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went\\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the\\nsnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more we\\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible\\nfright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and\\nsome bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror\\nthat they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in\\nthe night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.\\n\\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much\\nwith the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we\\nwere obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we\\nfound a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no\\nwolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse,\\nthey told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest\\nat the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the\\nground; but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would\\nventure to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it\\nwas surprising we were not all devoured. When we told them how we\\nplaced ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us\\nexceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all\\ndestroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so\\nfurious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really\\nafraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging on that\\naccount, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of\\ndanger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by\\nthe stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great\\nodds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content\\nto have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not\\nhave taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their\\nbacks, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we had\\nstood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to\\nhave devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having\\nour firearms in our hands, being so many in number. For my part, I was\\nnever so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred\\ndevils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing\\nto shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it\\nwas, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I\\nthink I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was\\nsure to meet with a storm once a-week.\\n\\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through\\nFrance nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with\\nmuch more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and\\nwithout any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover\\nthe 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel\\nin.\\n\\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time\\nall my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which\\nI brought with me having been currently paid.\\n\\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,\\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much\\nnor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that\\nI was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I\\nwas very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted\\nintegrity of this good gentlewoman.\\n\\nAnd now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it to the two\\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight\\nto a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.\\n\\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\\nexchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the\\nestate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him\\n(the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son\\nfor his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was\\nto make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part of\\na life of fortune and adventure a life of Providence s chequer-work,\\nand of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like\\nof; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of\\nit ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.\\n\\nAny one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I\\nwas past running any more hazards and so, indeed, I had been, if other\\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had\\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted\\nfresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet\\nI could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to\\nbe upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she\\nprevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews,\\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having\\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\\nsettlement of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I\\nplaced with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a\\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\\nand sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as\\nold as I was, to further adventures myself.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and\\nmy nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was\\nin the year 1694.\\n\\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\\nsubjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them a\\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\\naccidents as my own part particularly, also, as to their battles with\\nthe Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\\nimprovement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made\\nan attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and five\\nwomen prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\\nchildren on the island.\\n\\nHere I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary\\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\\nworkmen, which I had brought from England with me, viz. a carpenter and\\na smith.\\n\\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively\\nas they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged\\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.\\n\\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\\nI bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides\\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\\nI promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting which I\\nafterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and\\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart\\nfor them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\\nwere considerably increased.\\n\\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought\\nwith that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of\\nthem killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies  canoes,\\nthey famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and\\nrecovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the\\nisland.\\n\\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther\\naccount of in the Second Part of my Story.')"
